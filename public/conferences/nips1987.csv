abe4a95d4c,,,A Computer Simulation of Olfactory Cortex with Functional Implications for Storage and Retrieval of Olfactory Information,Based  on  anatomical  and  physiological  data##  we  have  developed  a  computer  simulation  of piri(cid:173) form  (olfactory)  cortex  which  is  capable  of reproducing  spatial  and  temporal  patterns  of actual  cortical  activity  under  a  variety  of conditions.  Using  a  simple  Hebb-type  learning  rule  in  conjunc(cid:173) tion  with  the  cortical  dynamics  which  emerge  from  the  anatomical  and  physiological  organiza(cid:173) tion  of  the  model##  the  simulations  are  capable  of establishing  cortical  representations  for  differ(cid:173) ent  input  patterns.  The  basis  of  these  representations  lies  in  the  interaction  of  sparsely  distribut(cid:173) ed##  highly  divergent/convergent  interconnections  between  modeled  neurons.  We  have  shown  that  different  representations  can  be  stored  with  minimal  interference.  and  that  following  learning  these  representations  are  resistant  to  input  degradation##  allowing  reconstruction  of  a  representa(cid:173) tion  following  only  a  partial  presentation  of  an  original  training  stimulus.  Further##  we  have  demonstrated  that  the  degree  of  overlap  of  cortical  representations  for  different  stimuli  can  also  be  modulated.  For  instance  similar  input  patterns  can  be  induced  to generate  distinct  cortical  representations  (discrimination).  while  dissimilar  inputs  can  be  induced  to  generate  overlapping  representations  (accommodation).  Both  features  are  presumably  important  in  classifying  olfacto(cid:173) ry stimuli.,0,0

An input vector in the feature space is transformed into an internal  representation which is a codeword in the code space## and then error correction  decoded in this space to classify the input feature vector to its class. Two classes  of codes which give high performance are the Hadamard matrix code and the  maximal length sequence code. We show that the number of classes stored in an  N-neuron system is linear in N and significantly more than that obtainable by  using the Hopfield type memory as a classifier.,0,0

6d82f5f123,,,Analysis of Distributed Representation of Constituent Structure in Connectionist Systems,A  general  method## the  tensor product representation## is described for  the distributed representation of  value/variable bindings.  The method allows the fully distributed representation of symbolic structures:  the roles  in  the structures## as well as the fillers  for  those roles## can be arbitrarily non-local.  Fully and  partially localized  special cases reduce to existing cases of connectionist representations of structured  data;  the  tensor  product  representation  generalizes  these  and  the  few  existing  examples  of  fuUy  distributed  representations  of structures.  The  representation  saturates  gracefully  as  larger  structures  are  represented;  it penn its  recursive  construction  of complex  representations  from  simpler  ones;  it  respects  the  independence  of the  capacities  to generate and  maintain  multiple bindings in  parallel;  it  extends naturally to continuous structures and continuous representational patterns; it pennits values to  also  serve  as  variables;  it  enables  analysis  of  the  interference  of  symbolic  structures  stored  in  associative  memories;  and  it  leads  to characterization  of optimal  distributed representations  of roles  and a recirculation algorithm for learning them.,0,0

Basin  measurement  circuitry  periodically  opens  the  network  feedback  loop##  loads  raster-scanned  initial  conditions  and  examines  the  resulting  attractor.  Plotting  the  basins  for  fixed  points  (memories)##  we  show  that  overloading  an  associative  memory  network  leads  to  irregular  basin  shapes.  The  network  also  includes  analog  time  delay  circuitry##  and  we  have  shown  that  delay  in  symmetric  networks  can  introduce  basins  for  oscillatory  attractors.  Conditions  leading  to  oscillation  are  related  to  the  presence  of  frustration;  reducing  frustration  by  diluting  the  connections  can  stabilize  a  delay  network.,0,0

d44610897d,,,Connectivity Versus Entropy,How  does  the  connectivity  of a  neural  network  (number  of synapses  per  neuron)  relate  to  the complexity  of the  problems  it  can  handle  (measured  by  the entropy)?  Switching theory would suggest no relation at all## since all Boolean  functions  can be  implemented  using  a  circuit  with very  low  connectivity  (e.g.##  using  two-input  NAND  gates).

ecddfd5175,,,Constrained Differential Optimization,Many optimization models of neural  networks need constraints to restrict the space of outputs to  a subspace which satisfies external criteria.  Optimizations using energy methods yield 'forces' which  act upon  the  state of the  neural  network.  The penalty method## in which quadratic  energy  constraints  are  added  to  an  existing  optimization  energy##  has  become  popular  recently##  but  is  not  guaranteed  to satisfy  the  constraint conditions  when  there  are  other forces  on  the  neural  model  or when  there  are  multiple constraints.  In this paper## we present the basic differential multiplier method (BDMM)##  which  satisfies constraints exactly;  we  create forces  which gradually apply  the constraints over time##  using 'neurons' that estimate Lagrange multipliers.,0,0
8bbc67de33,,,Correlational Strength and Computational Algebra of Synaptic Connections Between Neurons,Intracellular  recordings  in  spinal  cord  motoneurons  and  cerebral  cortex neurons have provided new evidence on the correlational strength of  monosynaptic  connections##  and  the  relation  between  the  shapes  of  postsynaptic  potentials  and  the  associated  increased  firing  probability.  In  these  cells##  excitatory  postsynaptic  potentials  (EPSPs)  produce  cross(cid:173) correlogram peaks  which resemble  in large part the derivative of  the EPSP.  Additional  synaptic  noise broadens  the peak##  but the  peak  area  -- i.e.##  the  number of above-chance firings triggered per EPSP -- remains proportional to  the EPSP  amplitude.  A typical EPSP of 100  ~v triggers about .01  firings per  EPSP.  The  consequences  of  these  data  for  information  processing  by  polysynaptic connections is discussed.  The effects of sequential polysynaptic  links  can  be  calculated  by  convolving  the  effects  of  the  underlying  monosynaptic connections.

b455f833f6,,,How Neural Nets Work,There is  presently great interest in the abilities of neural networks to mimic  'qualitative reasoning'  by manipulating neural incodings of symbols.  Less work  has  been performed on using neural networks to process floating  point numbers  and it is  sometimes stated that neural networks are somehow inherently inaccu(cid:173) rate  and  therefore  best  suited  for  'fuzzy'  qualitative reasoning.  Nevertheless##  the  potential  speed  of massively  parallel  operations  make  neural  net  'number  crunching'  an interesting topic  to explore.  In this paper we  discuss some of our  work in which we  demonstrate that for  certain applications neural networks can  achieve  significantly  higher  numerical  accuracy  than  more  conventional  tech(cid:173) niques.  In  particular##  prediction  of future  values  of a  chaotic  time  series  can  be  performed  with  exceptionally  high  accuracy.

53fb5cd301,,,Neural Net and Traditional Classifiers,Abstract.  Previous  work on  nets  with  continuous-valued inputs  led  to generative  procedures  to construct convex decision  regions with two-layer perceptrons (one hidden  layer) and  arbitrary decision  regions  with  three-layer perceptrons  (two hidden layers).  Here we demonstrate that two-layer perceptron classifiers trained with back propagation  can  form  both  convex  and  disjoint  decision  regions.  Such  classifiers  are  robust##  train  rapidly##  and  provide  good  performance  with  simple  decision  regions.  When  complex  decision  regions  are  required##  however##  convergence  time  can  be  excessively  long  and  performance is  often no better than that of k-nearest  neighbor classifiers.  Three neural  net  classifiers  are  presented  that  provide  more  rapid  training  under  such  situations.  Two use  fixed  weights in  the  first  one  or  two layers and  are  similar  to classifiers  that  estimate probability density functions using histograms.  A third 'feature map classifier'  uses  both  unsupervised  and  supervised  training.  It provides  good  performance  with  little supervised training in situations such as speech recognition where much unlabeled  training data is  available.  The architecture of this classifier can  be  used  to implement  a  neural net  k-nearest  neighbor classifier.,0,0

Known  re(cid:173) sults in  complexity theory are applied to the special instance of neural network  circuits##  and  in  particular##  classes  of functions  that  can  be  implemented  in  shallow circuits characterised.

c3ce3af75d,,,On the Power of Neural Networks for Solving Hard Problems,This  paper deals  with a  neural network model in  which each neuron  performs a  threshold logic function.  An important property of the model  is  that  it always  converges  to a  stable state  when  operating in  a  serial  mode [2##5].  This property is  the basis of the potential applications of the  model such as associative memory devices and combinatorial optimization  [3##6].  One of the motivations for use of the model for solving hard combinatorial  problems  is  the fact  that it can  be implemented  by optical devices  and  thus operate at a  higher speed  than conventional electronics.  The main theme in this work is  to investigate the power of the model for  solving NP-hard problems  [4##8]##  and to understand  the relation  between  speed of operation and the size of a  neural network.  In particular## it will  be  shown  that  for  any  NP-hard  problem  the  existence  of a  polynomial  size  network  that  solves  it  implies  that  NP=co-NP.  Also##  for  Traveling  Salesman  Problem  (TSP)## even  a  polynomial  size  network  that  gets  an  €-approximate  solution does  not exist unless  P=NP.,0,0
75b9d299b9,,,Optimal Neural Spike Classification,Being able  to record the electrical activities of a  number of neurons simultaneously is  likely  to be important in  the study of the functional organization of networks of real neurons.  Using  one  extracellular  microelectrode  to  record  from  several neurons  is  one  approach  to  studying  the  response  properties  of sets  of  adjacent  and  therefore  likely  related  neurons.  However##  to  do  this##  it  is  necessary  to  correctly  classify  the  signals  generated  by  these  different  neurons.  This paper considers  this problem of classifying the  signals  in  such an  extracellular recording##  based upon their shapes## and specifically considers the classification of signals in the case when  spikes overlap  temporally.,0,0
