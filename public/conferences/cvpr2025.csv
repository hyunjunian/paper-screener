35072,,2412.00678,2DMamba: Efficient State Space Model for Image Representation with Applications on Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Image Classification,Efficiently modeling large 2D contexts is essential for various fields including Giga-Pixel Whole Slide Imaging (WSI) and remote sensing. Transformer-based models offer high parallelism but face challenges due to their quadratic complexity for handling long sequences. Recently## Mamba introduced a selective State Space Model (SSM) with linear complexity and high parallelism## enabling effective and efficient modeling of wide context in 1D sequences. However## extending Mamba to vision tasks## which inherently involve 2D structures## results in spatial discrepancies due to the limitations of 1D sequence processing. On the other hand## current 2D SSMs inherently model 2D structures but they suffer from prohibitively slow computation due to the lack of efficient parallel algorithms. In this work## we propose 2DMamba## a novel 2D selective SSM framework that incorporates the 2D spatial structure of images into Mamba## with a highly optimized hardware-aware operator## adopting both spatial continuity and computational efficiency. We validate the versatility of our approach on both WSIs and natural images. Extensive experiments on 10 public datasets for WSI classification and survival analysis show that 2DMamba improves up to 2.48% in AUC## 3.11% in F1 score## 2.47% in accuracy and 5.52% in C-index. Additionally## integrating our method with VMamba for natural imaging yields 0.5 to 0.7 improvements in mIoU on the ADE20k semantic segmentation dataset## and 0.2% accuracy improvement on ImageNet-1K classification dataset.

33359,,2411.14974,3D Convex Splatting: Radiance Field Rendering with 3D Smooth Convexes,Recent advances in radiance field reconstruction## such as 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS)## have achieved high-quality novel view synthesis and fast rendering by representing scenes with compositions of Gaussian primitives. However## 3D Gaussians present several limitations for scene reconstruction. Accurately capturing hard edges is challenging without significantly increasing the number of Gaussians## creating a large memory footprint. Moreover## they struggle to represent flat surfaces## as they are diffused in space. Without hand-crafted regularizers## they tend to disperse irregularly around the actual surface. To circumvent these issues## we introduce a novel method## named 3D Convex Splatting (3DCS)## which leverages 3D smooth convexes as primitives for modeling geometrically-meaningful radiance fields from multi-view images. Smooth convex shapes offer greater flexibility than Gaussians## allowing for a better representation of 3D scenes with hard edges and dense volumes using fewer primitives. Powered by our efficient CUDA-based rasterizer## 3DCS achieves superior performance over 3DGS on benchmarks such as Mip-NeRF360## Tanks and Temples## and Deep Blending. Specifically## our method attains an improvement of up to 0.81 in PSNR and 0.026 in LPIPS compared to 3DGS while maintaining high rendering speeds and reducing the number of required primitives. Our results highlight the potential of 3D Convex Splatting to become the new standard for high-quality scene reconstruction and novel view synthesis.

In specific## we introduce an expressive and compact representation that encodes texture-related attributes of the 3D Gaussians in the tensorial format. We store appearance of neutral expression in static tri-planes## and represents dynamic texture details for different expressions using lightweight 1D feature lines## which are then decoded into opacity offset relative to the neutral face. We further propose adaptive truncated opacity penalty and class-balanced sampling to improve generalization across different expressions. Experiments show this design enables accurate face dynamic details capturing while maintains real-time rendering and significantly reduces storage costs## thus broadening the applicability to more scenarios.,0,0

32422,,2503.15185,3D Occupancy Prediction with Low-Resolution Queries via Prototype-aware View Transformation,The resolution of voxel queries significantly influences the quality of view transformation in camera-based 3D occupancy prediction. However## computational constraints and the practical necessity for real-time deployment require smaller query resolutions## which inevitably leads to an information loss. Therefore## it is essential to encode and preserve rich visual details within limited query sizes while ensuring a comprehensive representation of 3D occupancy. To this end## we introduce ProtoOcc## a novel occupancy network that leverages prototypes of clustered image segments in view transformation to enhance low-resolution context. In particular## the mapping of 2D prototypes onto 3D voxel queries encodes high-level visual geometries and complements the loss of spatial information from reduced query resolutions. Additionally## we design a multi-perspective decoding strategy to efficiently disentangle the densely compressed visual cues into a high-dimensional 3D occupancy scene. Experimental results on both Occ3D and SemanticKITTI benchmarks demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method## showing clear improvements over the baselines. More importantly## ProtoOcc achieves competitive performance against the baselines even with 75% reduced voxel resolution.,0,0
33580,,2502.04074,3D Prior Is All You Need: Cross-Task Few-shot 2D Gaze Estimation,3D and 2D gaze estimation share the fundamental objective of capturing eye movements but are traditionally treated as two distinct research domains. In this paper## we introduce a novel cross-task few-shot 2D gaze estimation approach## aiming to adapt a pre-trained 3D gaze estimation network for 2D gaze prediction on unseen devices using only a few training images. This task is highly challenging due to the domain gap between 3D and 2D gaze## unknown screen poses## and limited training data. To address these challenges## we propose a novel framework that bridges the gap between 3D and 2D gaze. Our framework contains a physics-based differentiable projection module with learnable parameters to model screen poses and project 3D gaze into 2D gaze. The framework is fully differentiable and can integrate into existing 3D gaze networks without modifying their original architecture. Additionally## we introduce a dynamic pseudo-labelling strategy for flipped images## which is particularly challenging for 2D labels due to unknown screen poses. To overcome this## we reverse the projection process by converting 2D labels to 3D space## where flipping is performed. Notably## this 3D space is not aligned with the camera coordinate system## so we learn a dynamic transformation matrix to compensate for this misalignment. We evaluate our method on MPIIGaze## EVE## and GazeCapture datasets## collected respectively on laptops## desktop computers## and mobile devices. The superior performance highlights the effectiveness of our approach## and demonstrates its strong potential for real-world applications.,0,0
34657,,2503.10148,3D Student Splatting and Scooping,Recently## 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) provides a new framework for novel view synthesis## and has spiked a new wave of research in neural rendering and related applications. As 3DGS is becoming a foundational component of many models## any improvement on 3DGS itself can bring huge benefits. To this end## we aim to improve the fundamental paradigm and formulation of 3DGS. We argue that as an unnormalized mixture model## it needs to be neither Gaussians nor splatting. We subsequently propose a new mixture model consisting of flexible Student's t distributions## with both positive (splatting) and negative (scooping) densities. We name our model Student Splatting and Scooping## or SSS. When providing better expressivity## SSS also poses new challenges in learning.

33831,,,3D-AVS: LiDAR-based 3D Auto-Vocabulary Segmentation,Open-vocabulary segmentation methods offer promising capabilities in detecting unseen object categories## but the category must be aware and needs to be provided by a human## either via a text prompt or pre-labeled datasets## thus limiting their scalability. We propose 3D-AVS## a method for Auto-Vocabulary Segmentation of 3D point clouds for which the vocabulary is unknown and auto-generated for each input at runtime## thus eliminating the human in the loop and typically providing a substantially larger vocabulary for richer annotations. 3D-AVS first recognizes semantic entities from image or point cloud data and then segments all points with the automatically generated vocabulary. Our method incorporates both image-based and point-based recognition## enhancing robustness under challenging lighting conditions where geometric information from LiDAR is especially valuable. Our point-based recognition features a Sparse Masked Attention Pooling (SMAP) module to enrich the diversity of recognized objects. To address the challenges of evaluating unknown vocabularies and avoid annotation biases from label synonyms## hierarchies## or semantic overlaps## we introduce the annotation-free Text-Point Semantic Similarity (TPSS) metric for assessing generated vocabulary quality. Our evaluations on nuScenes and ScanNet200 demonstrate 3D-AVS's ability to generate semantic classes with accurate point-wise segmentations.,0,0
33422,,,3D-GRAND: A Million-Scale Dataset for 3D-LLMs with Better Grounding and Less Hallucination,The integration of language and 3D perception is crucial for embodied agents and robots that comprehend and interact with the physical world. While large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated impressive language understanding and generation capabilities## their adaptation to 3D environments (3D-LLMs) remains in its early stages. A primary challenge is a lack of large-scale datasets with dense grounding between language and 3D scenes. We introduce 3D-GRAND## a pioneering large-scale dataset comprising 40##087 household scenes paired with 6.2 million densely-grounded scene-language instructions. Our results show that instruction tuning with 3D-GRAND significantly enhances grounding capabilities and reduces hallucinations in 3D-LLMs. As part of our contributions## we propose a comprehensive benchmark 3D-POPE to systematically evaluate hallucination in 3D-LLMs## enabling fair comparisons of models. Our experiments highlight a scaling effect between dataset size and 3D-LLM performance## emphasizing the importance of large-scale 3D-text datasets for embodied AI research. Our results demonstrate early signals for effective sim-to-real transfer## indicating that models trained on large synthetic data can perform well on real-world 3D scans.

35252,,,3D-GSW: 3D Gaussian Splatting for Robust Watermarking,As 3D Gaussian Splatting (3D-GS) gains significant attention and its commercial usage increases## the need for watermarking technologies to prevent unauthorized use of the 3D-GS models and rendered images has become increasingly important. In this paper## we introduce a robust watermarking method for 3D-GS that secures copyright of both the model and its rendered images. Our proposed method remains robust against distortions in rendered images and model attacks while maintaining high rendering quality. To achieve these objectives## we present Frequency-Guided Densification (FGD)## which removes 3D Gaussians based on their contribution to rendering quality## enhancing real-time rendering and the robustness of the message. FGD utilizes Discrete Fourier Transform to split 3D Gaussians in high-frequency areas## improving rendering quality. Furthermore## we employ a gradient mask for 3D Gaussians and design a wavelet-subband loss to enhance rendering quality. Our experiments show that our method embeds the message in the rendered images invisibly and robustly against various attacks## including model distortion.

However## how to further enhance 3D LMMs to achieve fine-grained scene understanding and facilitate flexible human-agent interaction remains a challenging problem. In this work## we introduce 3D-LLaVA## a simple yet highly powerful 3D LMM designed to act as an intelligent assistant in comprehending## reasoning## and interacting with the 3D world. Unlike existing top-performing methods that rely on complicated pipelines--such as offline multi-view feature extraction or additional task-specific heads--3D-LLaVA adopts a minimalist design with integrated architecture and only takes point clouds as input.

34125,,,3D-Mem: 3D Scene Memory for Embodied Exploration and Reasoning,Constructing compact and informative 3D scene representations is essential for effective embodied exploration and reasoning## especially in complex environments over extended periods. Existing representations## such as object-centric 3D scene graphs## oversimplify spatial relationships by modeling scenes as isolated objects with restrictive textual relationships## making it difficult to address queries requiring nuanced spatial understanding.

The representation defines a global signed distance function (SDF) in near-surface space based on a set of band-limited local SDFs anchored at support points sampled from point clouds. These SDFs are parameterized only by a tiny multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with no latent features## and the state of each SDF is modulated by three learnable geometric properties: position## rotation## and scaling## which make the representation adapt to complex geometries. Then## we develop a novel parallel algorithm tailored for this unordered representation to efficiently detect local SDFs where each sampled point is located## allowing for real-time updates of local SDF states during training. Additionally## a prune-and-expand strategy is introduced to enhance adaptability further. The synergy of our low-parameter model and its adaptive capabilities results in an extremely compact representation with excellent expressiveness.

However## due to its rasterization-based formulation## 3DGS is constrained to ideal pinhole cameras and lacks support for secondary lighting effects. Recent methods address these limitations by tracing the particles instead## but## this comes at the cost of significantly slower rendering. In this work## we propose 3D Gaussian Unscented Transform (3DGUT)## replacing the EWA splatting formulation with the Unscented Transform that approximates the particles through sigma points## which can be projected exactly under any nonlinear projection function. This modification enables trivial support of distorted cameras with time dependent effects such as rolling shutter## while retaining the efficiency of rasterization. Additionally## we align our rendering formulation with that of tracing-based methods## enabling secondary ray tracing required to represent phenomena such as reflections and refraction within the same 3D representation.

34514,,2503.10437,4D LangSplat: 4D Language Gaussian Splatting via Multimodal Large Language Models,Learning 4D language fields to enable time-sensitive## open-ended language queries in dynamic scenes is essential for many real-world applications. While LangSplat successfully grounds CLIP features into 3D Gaussian representations## achieving precision and efficiency in 3D static scenes## it lacks the ability to handle dynamic 4D fields as CLIP## designed for static image-text tasks## cannot capture temporal dynamics in videos. Real-world environments are inherently dynamic## with object semantics evolving over time. Building a precise 4D language field necessitates obtaining pixel-aligned## object-wise video features## which current vision models struggle to achieve. To address these challenges## we propose 4D LangSplat## which learns 4D language fields to handle time-agnostic or time-sensitive open-vocabulary queries in dynamic scenes efficiently. 4D LangSplat bypasses learning the language field from vision features and instead learns directly from text generated from object-wise video captions via Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs). Specifically## we propose a multimodal object-wise video prompting method## consisting of visual and text prompts that guide MLLMs to generate detailed## temporally consistent## high-quality captions for objects throughout a video. These captions are encoded using a Large Language Model into high-quality sentence embeddings## which then serve as pixel-aligned## object-specific feature supervision## facilitating open-vocabulary text queries through shared embedding spaces. Recognizing that objects in 4D scenes exhibit smooth transitions across states## we further propose a status deformable network to model these continuous changes over time effectively. Our results across multiple benchmarks demonstrate that 4D LangSplat attains precise and efficient results for both time-sensitive and time-agnostic open-vocabulary queries.,0,0

34704,,2408.08345,5%>100%: Breaking Performance Shackles of Full Fine-Tuning on Visual Recognition Tasks,Pre-training & fine-tuning can enhance the transferring efficiency and performance in visual tasks. Recent delta-tuning methods provide more options for visual classification tasks. Despite their success## existing visual delta-tuning art fails to exceed the upper limit of full fine-tuning on challenging tasks. To find a competitive alternative to full fine-tuning## we propose the Multi-cognitive Visual Adapter (Mona) tuning## a novel adapter-based tuning method. First## we introduce multiple vision-friendly filters into the adapter to enhance its ability for processing visual signals## while previous methods mainly rely on language-friendly linear filters.

To fully demonstrate the practicality and generality of Mona## we conduct experiments on representative visual tasks## including instance segmentation on COCO## semantic segmentation on ADE20K## object detection on Pascal VOC## oriented object detection on DOTA/STAR## and image classification on three common datasets. Exciting results illustrate that Mona surpasses full fine-tuning on all these tasks by tuning less than 5% params of the backbone## and is the only delta-tuning method outperforming full fine-tuning on all tasks. For example## Mona achieves 1% performance gain on the COCO compared to full fine-tuning. Comprehensive results suggest that Mona-tuning is more suitable for retaining and utilizing the capabilities of pre-trained models than full fine-tuning.

34882,,2412.17671,A Bias-Free Training Paradigm for More General AI-generated Image Detection,Successful forensic detectors can produce excellent results in supervised learning benchmarks but struggle to transfer to real-world applications. We believe this limitation is largely due to inadequate training data quality. While most research focuses on developing new algorithms## less attention is given to training data selection## despite evidence that performance can be strongly impacted by spurious correlations such as content## format## or resolution. A well-designed forensic detector should detect generator specific artifacts rather than reflect data biases. To this end## we propose B-Free## a bias-free training paradigm## where fake images are generated from real ones using the conditioning procedure of stable diffusion models. This ensures semantic alignment between real and fake images## allowing any differences to stem solely from the subtle artifacts introduced by AI generation. Through content-based augmentation## we show significant improvements in both generalization and robustness over state-of-the-art detectors and more calibrated results across 27 different generative models## including recent releases## like FLUX and Stable Diffusion 3.5.

33577,,2503.18434,A Simple yet Effective Layout Token in Large Language Models for Document Understanding,Recent methods that integrate spatial layouts with text for document understanding in large language models (LLMs) have shown promising results. A commonly used method is to represent layout information as text tokens and interleave them with text content as inputs to the LLMs. However## such a method still demonstrates limitations## as it requires additional position IDs for tokens that are used to represent layout information. Due to the constraint on max position IDs## assigning them to layout information reduces those available for text content## reducing the capacity for the model to learn from the text during training## while also introducing a large number of potentially untrained position IDs during long-context inference## which can hinder performance on document understanding tasks. To address these issues## we propose LayTokenLLM## a simple yet effective method for document understanding. LayTokenLLM represents layout information as a single token per text segment and uses a specialized positional encoding scheme. It shares position IDs between text and layout tokens## eliminating the need for additional position IDs. This design maintains the model's capacity to learn from text while mitigating long-context issues during inference. Furthermore## a novel pre-training objective called Next Interleaved Text and Layout Token Prediction (NTLP) is devised to enhance cross-modality learning between text and layout tokens.

A promising approach to accelerating large VLM inference is using partial information## such as attention maps from specific layers## to assess token importance and prune less essential tokens. However## our study reveals three key insights: (i) Partial attention information is insufficient for accurately identifying critical visual tokens## resulting in suboptimal performance## especially at low token retention ratios; (ii) Global attention information## such as the attention map aggregated across all layers## more effectively preserves essential tokens and maintains performance under aggressive pruning. However## it requires a full inference pass## which increases computational load and is therefore impractical in existing methods; and (iii) The global attention map aggregated from a small VLM closely resembles that of a large VLM## suggesting an efficient alternative.

34814,,,A Unified Approach to Interpreting Self-supervised Pre-training Methods for 3D Point Clouds via Interactions,Recently## many self-supervised pre-training methods have been proposed to improve the performance of deep neural networks (DNNs) for 3D point clouds processing. However## the common mechanism underlying the effectiveness of different pre-training methods remains unclear. In this paper## we use game-theoretic interactions as a unified approach to explore the common mechanism of pre-training methods. Specifically## we decompose the output score of a DNN into the sum of numerous effects of interactions## with each interaction representing a distinct 3D substructure of the input point cloud. Based on the decomposed interactions## we draw the following conclusions. (1) The common mechanism across different pre-training methods is that they enhance the strength of high-order interactions encoded by DNNs## which represent complex and global 3D structures## while reducing the strength of low-order interactions## which represent simple and local 3D structures. (2) Sufficient pre-training and adequate fine-tuning data for downstream tasks further reinforce the mechanism described above. (3) Pre-training methods carry a potential risk of reducing the transferability of features encoded by DNNs. Inspired by the observed common mechanism## we propose a new method to directly enhance the strength of high-order interactions and reduce the strength of low-order interactions encoded by DNNs## improving performance without the need for pre-training on large-scale datasets.

34455,,,ABC-Former: Auxiliary Bimodal Cross-domain Transformer with Interactive Channel Attention for White Balance,The primary goal of white balance (WB) for sRGB images is to correct inaccurate color temperatures## ensuring that images display natural## neutral colors. While existing WB methods yield reasonable results## their effectiveness is limited. They either focus solely on global color adjustments applied before the camera-specific image signal processing pipeline or rely on end-to-end models that generate WB outputs without accounting for global color trends## leading to suboptimal correction. To address these limitations## we propose an Auxiliary Bimodal Cross-domain Transformer (ABC-Former) that enhances WB correction by leveraging complementary knowledge from global color information from CIELab and RGB histograms alongside sRGB inputs. By introducing an Interactive Channel Attention (ICA) module to facilitate cross-modality global knowledge transfer## ABC-Former achieves more precise WB correction. Experimental results on benchmark WB datasets show that ABC-Former performs favorably against state-of-the-art WB methods.

In this work## we analyze camera motion from a first principles perspective## uncovering insights that enable precise 3D camera manipulation without compromising synthesis quality. First## we determine that motion induced by camera movements in videos is low-frequency in nature. This motivates us to adjust train and test pose conditioning schedules## accelerating training convergence while improving visual and motion quality. Then## by probing the representations of an unconditional video diffusion transformer## we observe that they implicitly perform camera pose estimation under the hood## and only a sub-portion of their layers contain the camera information. This suggested us to limit the injection of camera conditioning to a subset of the architecture to prevent interference with other video features## leading to a 4x reduction of training parameters## improved training speed## and 10% higher visual quality. Finally## we complement the typical dataset for camera control learning with a curated dataset of 20K diverse## dynamic videos with stationary cameras. This helps the model distinguish between camera and scene motion and improves the dynamics of generated pose-conditioned videos. We compound these findings to design the Advanced 3D Camera Control (AC3D) architecture## the new state-of-the-art model for generative video modeling with camera control.,0,0

Existing concept erasure methods achieve superior results in preventing the production of erased concept from prompts## but typically perform poorly in preventing undesired editing. To address this issue## we propose an Anti-Editing Concept Erasure (ACE) method## which not only erases the target concept during generation but also filters out it during editing. Specifically## we propose to inject the erasure guidance into both conditional and the unconditional noise prediction## enabling the model to effectively prevent the creation of erasure concepts during both editing and generation. Furthermore## a stochastic correction guidance is introduced during training to address the erosion of unrelated concepts. We conducted erasure editing experiments with representative editing methods (i.e.## LEDITS++ and MasaCtrl) to erase IP characters## and the results indicate that our ACE effectively filters out target concepts in both types of edits. Additional experiments on erasing explicit concepts and artistic styles further demonstrate that our ACE performs favorably against state-of-the-art methods.

To address these## we propose ADU## a framework that allows the target domain to autonomously learn pseudo-labels guided by quality and use an adaptive threshold to identify 'unknown' categories. Specifically## ADU consists of Selective Amplification Knowledge Distillation (SAKD) and Entopy-Driven Label Differentiation (EDLD). SAKD improves KD by focusing on high-quality pseudo-labels## mitigating the impact of noisy labels.

However## existing methods often face limitations in the diversity and quality of synthetic data## leading to compromised fairness and overall model accuracy. Moreover## many approaches rely on the availability of demographic group labels## which are often costly to annotate. This paper proposes AIM-Fair## aiming to overcome these limitations and harness the potential of cutting-edge generative models in promoting algorithmic fairness. We investigate a fine-tuning paradigm starting from a biased model initially trained on real-world data without demographic annotations. This model is then fine-tuned using unbiased synthetic data generated by a state-of-the-art diffusion model to improve its fairness. Two key challenges are identified in this fine-tuning paradigm## 1) the low quality of synthetic data## which can still happen even with advanced generative models## and 2) the domain and bias gap between real and synthetic data. To address the limitation of synthetic data quality## we propose Contextual Synthetic Data Generation (CSDG) to generate data using a text-to-image diffusion model (T2I) with prompts generated by a context-aware LLM## ensuring both data diversity and control of bias in synthetic data. To resolve domain and bias shifts## we introduce a novel selective fine-tuning scheme in which only model parameters more sensitive to bias and less sensitive to domain shift are updated.

32408,,,Adaptive Part Learning for Fine-Grained Generalized Category Discovery: A Plug-and-Play Enhancement,Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) aims to recognize unlabeled images from known and novel classes by distinguishing novel classes from known ones## while also transferring knowledge from another set of labeled images with known classes. Existing GCD methods rely on self-supervised vision transformers such as DINO for representation learning. However## focusing solely on the global representation of the DINO CLS token introduces an inherent trade-off between discriminability and generalization.

34252,,2503.18595,Adaptive Unimodal Regulation for Balanced Multimodal Information Acquisition,Sensory training during the early ages is vital for human development. Inspired by this cognitive phenomenon## we observe that the early training stage is also important for the multimodal learning process## where dataset information is rapidly acquired. We refer to this stage as the prime learning window. However## based on our observation## this prime learning window in multimodal learning is often dominated by information-sufficient modalities## which in turn suppresses the information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. To address this issue## we propose Information Acquisition Regulation (InfoReg)## a method designed to balance information acquisition among modalities. Specifically## InfoReg slows down the information acquisition process of information-sufficient modalities during the prime learning window## which could promote information acquisition of information-insufficient modalities. This regulation enables a more balanced learning process and improves the overall performance of the multimodal network. Experiments show that InfoReg outperforms related multimodal imbalanced methods across various datasets## achieving superior model performance.

However## conventional MIL models often lack adaptability to evolving datasets## as they rely on static training that cannot incorporate new information without extensive retraining. Applying continual learning (CL) to MIL models is a possible solution## but often sees limited improvements. In this paper## we analyze CL in the context of attention MIL models and find that the model forgetting is mainly concentrated in the attention layers of the MIL model. Using the results of this analysis we propose two components for improving CL on MIL:Attention Knowledge Distillation (AKD) and the Pseudo-Bag Memory Pool (PMP). AKD mitigates catastrophic forgetting by focusing on retaining attention layer knowledge between learning sessions## while PMP reduces the memory footprint by selectively storing only the most informative patches## or 'pseudo-bags' from WSIs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly improves both accuracy and memory efficiency on diverse WSI datasets## outperforming current state-of-the-art CL methods.

This modeling paradigm allows us to process images in a recurrent formulation with linear complexity relative to the sequence length## which can effectively address the memory and computation explosion issues posed by high-resolution and fine-grained images. In detail## we introduce two simple designs that seamlessly integrate image inputs into the causal inference framework: a global pooling token placed at the beginning of the sequence and a flipping operation between every two layers. Extensive empirical studies highlight that compared with the existing plain architectures such as DeiT and Vim## Adventurer offers an optimal efficiency-accuracy trade-off. For example## our Adventurer-Base attains a competitive test accuracy of 84.3% on the standard ImageNet-1k benchmark with 216 images/s training throughput## which is 3.8x and 6.2x faster than Vim and DeiT to achieve the same result.

33467,,2411.13383,Adversarial Diffusion Compression for Real-World Image Super-Resolution,Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex## unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success## their slow## multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method## AdcSR## by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff## categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder## prompt extractor## text encoder## etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability## we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time## 78% in computation## and 74% in parameters## while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets## offering up to 9.3x speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods.

33611,,,Adversarial Domain Prompt Tuning and Generation for Single Domain Generalization,Single domain generalization (SDG) aims to learn a robust model## which could perform well on many unseen domains while there is only one single domain available for training. One of the promising directions for achieving single-domain generalization is to generate out-of-domain (OOD) training data through data augmentation or image generation. Given the rapid advancements in AI-generated content (AIGC)## this paper is the first to propose leveraging powerful pre-trained text-to-image (T2I) foundation models to create the training data. However## manually designing textual prompts to generate images for all possible domains is often impractical## and some domain characteristics may be too abstract to describe with words. To address these challenges## we propose a novel Progressive Adversarial Prompt Tuning (PAPT) framework for pre-trained diffusion models. Instead of relying on static textual domains## our approach learns two sets of abstract prompts as conditions for the diffusion model: one that captures domain-invariant category information and another that models domain-specific styles. This adversarial learning mechanism enables the T2I model to generate images in various domain styles while preserving key categorical features.

33179,,,AeSPa : Attention-guided Self-supervised Parallel Imaging for MRI Reconstruction,This study introduces a novel zero-shot scan-specific self-supervised reconstruction method for magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to reduce scan times. Conventional supervised reconstruction methods require large amounts of fully-sampled reference data## which is often impractical to obtain and can lead to artifacts by overly emphasizing learned patterns. Existing zero-shot scan-specific methods have attempted to overcome this data dependency but show limited performance due to insufficient utilization of k-space information and constraints derived from MRI forward model. To address these limitations## we introduce a framework utilizing all acquired k-space measurements for both network inputs and training targets. While this framework suffers from training instability## we resolve these challenges through three key components: an Attention-guided K-space Selective Mechanism (AKSM) that provides indirect constraints for non-sampled k-space points## Iteration-wise K-space Masking (IKM) that enhances training stability## and a robust sensitivity map estimation model utilizing cross-channel constraint that performs effectively even at high reduction factors. Experimental results on the FastMRI knee and brain datasets with reduction factors of 4 and 8 demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior reconstruction quality and faster convergence compared to existing zero-shot scan-specific methods## making it suitable for practical clinical applications.

32988,,2504.13157,AerialMegaDepth: Learning Aerial-Ground Reconstruction and View Synthesis,We explore the task of geometric reconstruction of images captured from a mixture of ground and aerial views. Current state-of-the-art learning-based approaches fail to handle the extreme viewpoint variation between aerial-ground image pairs. Our hypothesis is that the lack of high-quality## co-registered aerial-ground datasets for training is a key reason for this failure. Such data is difficult to assemble precisely because it is difficult to reconstruct in a scalable way. To overcome this challenge## we propose a scalable framework combining pseudo-synthetic renderings from 3D city-wide meshes (e.g.## Google Earth) with real## ground-level crowd-sourced images (e.g.## MegaDepth). The pseudo-synthetic data simulates a wide range of aerial viewpoints## while the real## crowd-sourced images help improve visual fidelity for ground-level images where mesh-based renderings lack sufficient detail## effectively bridging the domain gap between real images and pseudo-synthetic renderings. Using this hybrid dataset## we fine-tune several state-of-the-art algorithms and achieve significant improvements on real-world## zero-shot aerial-ground tasks. For example## we observe that baseline DUSt3R localizes fewer than 5% of aerial-ground pairs within 5 degrees of camera rotation error## while fine-tuning with our data raises accuracy to nearly 56%## addressing a major failure point in handling large viewpoint changes. Beyond camera estimation and scene reconstruction## our dataset also improves performance on downstream tasks like novel-view synthesis in challenging aerial-ground scenarios## demonstrating the practical value of our approach in real-world applications.,0,0

34123,,2503.00591,AesthetiQ: Enhancing Graphic Layout Design via Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment of Multi-modal Large Language Models,Visual layouts are essential in graphic design fields such as advertising## posters## and web interfaces. The application of generative models for content-aware layout generation has recently gained traction. However## these models fail to understand the contextual aesthetic requirements of layout design and do not align with human-like preferences## primarily treating it as a prediction task without considering the final rendered output. To overcome these problems## we offer Aesthetic-Aware Preference Alignment (AAPA)## a novel technique to train a Multi-modal Large Language Model (MLLM) for layout prediction that uses MLLM's aesthetic preferences for Direct Preference Optimization over graphic layouts.

Additionally## we introduce a novel evaluation metric that uses another MLLM to compute the win rate of the generated layout against the ground-truth layout based on aesthetics criteria. We also demonstrate the applicability of AAPA for MLLMs of varying scales (1B to 8B parameters) and LLM families (Qwen## Phi## InternLM). By conducting thorough qualitative and quantitative analyses## we verify the efficacy of our approach on two challenging benchmarks - Crello and Webui## showcasing 17%## and 16% improvement over current State-of-The-Art methods## thereby highlighting the potential of MLLMs in aesthetic-aware layout generation.,0,0
33341,,2406.04314,Aesthetic Post-Training Diffusion Models from Generic Preferences with Step-by-step Preference Optimization,Generating visually appealing images is fundamental to modern text-to-image generation models. A potential solution to better aesthetics is direct preference optimization (DPO)## which has been applied to diffusion models to improve general image quality including prompt alignment and aesthetics. Popular DPO methods propagate preference labels from clean image pairs to all the intermediate steps along the two generation trajectories. However## preference labels provided in existing datasets are blended with layout and aesthetic opinions## which would disagree with aesthetic preference. Even if aesthetic labels were provided (at substantial cost)## it would be hard for the two-trajectory methods to capture nuanced visual differences at different steps. To improve aesthetics economically## this paper uses existing generic preference data and introduces step-by-step preference optimization (SPO) that discards the propagation strategy and allows fine-grained image details to be assessed. Specifically## at each denoising step## we 1) sample a pool of candidates by denoising from a shared noise latent## 2) use a step-aware preference model to find a suitable win-lose pair to supervise the diffusion model## and 3) randomly select one from the pool to initialize the next denoising step. This strategy ensures that diffusion models focus on the subtle## fine-grained visual differences instead of layout aspect. We find that aesthetics can be significantly enhanced by accumulating these improved minor differences. When fine-tuning Stable Diffusion v1.5 and SDXL## SPO yields significant improvements in aesthetics compared with existing DPO methods while not sacrificing image-text alignment compared with vanilla models. Moreover## SPO converges much faster than DPO methods due to the use of more correct preference labels provided by the step-aware preference model.

33395,,2412.03142,AffordDP: Generalizable Diffusion Policy with Transferable Affordance,Diffusion-based policies have shown impressive performance in robotic manipulation tasks while struggling with out-of-domain distributions. Recent efforts attempted to enhance generalization by improving the visual feature encoding for diffusion policy. However## their generalization is typically limited to the same category with similar appearances. Our key insight is that leveraging affordances--manipulation priors that define 'where' and 'how' an agent interacts with an object--can substantially enhance generalization to entirely unseen object instances and categories. We introduce the Diffusion Policy with transferable Affordance (AffordDP)## designed for generalizable manipulation across novel categories. AffordDP models affordances through 3D contact points and post-contact trajectories## capturing the essential static and dynamic information for complex tasks. The transferable affordance from in-domain data to unseen objects is achieved by estimating a 6D transformation matrix using foundational vision models and point cloud registration techniques. More importantly## we incorporate affordance guidance during diffusion sampling that can refine action sequence generation. This guidance directs the generated action to gradually move towards the desired manipulation for unseen objects while keeping the generated action within the manifold of action space. Experimental results from both simulated and real-world environments demonstrate that AffordDP consistently outperforms previous diffusion-based methods## successfully generalizing to unseen instances and categories where others fail.,0,0

This hinders their applicability in applications requiring consistent results. In this work## we redesign LDMs to enhance consistency by making them shift-equivariant. While introducing anti-aliasing operations can partially improve shift-equivariance## significant aliasing and inconsistency persist due to the unique challenges in LDMs## including 1) aliasing amplification during VAE training and multiple U-Net inferences## and 2) self-attention modules that inherently lack shift-equivariance. To address these issues## we redesign the attention modules to be shift-equivariant and propose an equivariance loss that effectively suppresses the frequency bandwidth of the features in the continuous domain. The resulting alias-free LDM (AF-LDM) achieves strong shift-equivariance and is also robust to irregular warping.

32695,,,All-directional Disparity Estimation for Real-world QPD Images,Quad Photodiode (QPD) sensors represent an evolution by providing four sub-views## whereas dual-pixel (DP) sensors are limited to two sub-views. In addition to enhancing auto-focus performance## QPD sensors also enable disparity estimation in horizontal and vertical directions. However## the characteristics of QPD sensors## including uneven illumination across sub-views and the narrow baseline## render algorithm design difficult.

Despite numerous advancements## challenges persist in accurately predicting both the location and intensity of precipitation## as these factors are often interdependent## with complex atmospheric dynamics and moisture distribution causing position and intensity changes to be intricately coupled. Inspired by the fact that in the frequency domain## phase variations are shown to correspond to changes in the position of precipitation## while amplitude variations are linked to intensity changes## we propose an amplitude-phase disentanglement model called AlphaPre## which separately learn the position and intensity changes of precipitation. AlphaPre comprises three key components: a phase network## an amplitude network## and an AlphaMixer. The phase network captures positional changes by learning phase variations## while the amplitude network models intensity changes by alternating between the frequency and spatial domains. The AlphaMixer then integrates these components to produce a refined precipitation forecast. Extensive experiments on four datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of our method over state-of-the-art approaches.

34126,,,Anatomical Consistency and Adaptive Prior-informed Transformation for Multi-contrast MR Image Synthesis via Diffusion Model,Multi-contrast magnetic resonance (MR) images offer critical diagnostic information but are limited by long scan times and high cost. While diffusion models (DMs) excel in medical image synthesis## they often struggle to maintain anatomical consistency and utilize the diverse characteristics of multi-contrast MR images effectively. We propose APT## a unified diffusion model designed to generate accurate and anatomically consistent multi-contrast MR images. APT introduces a mutual information fusion module and an anatomical consistency loss to preserve critical anatomical structures across multiple contrast inputs. To enhance synthesis## APT incorporates a two-stage inference process: in the first stage## a prior codebook provides coarse anatomical structures by selecting appropriate guidance based on precomputed similarity mappings and Bezier curve transformations. The second stage applies iterative unrolling with weighted averaging to refine the initial output## enhancing fine anatomical details and ensuring structural consistency. This approach enables the preservation of both global structures and local details## resulting in realistic and diagnostically valuable synthesized images. Extensive experiments on public multi-contrast MR brain images demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods.

33991,,,Anchor-Aware Similarity Cohesion in Target Frames Enables Predicting Temporal Moment Boundaries in 2D,Video moment retrieval aims to locate specific moments from a video according to the query text. This task presents two main challenges: i) aligning the query and video frames at the feature level## and ii) projecting the query-aligned frame features to the start and end boundaries of the matching interval. Previous work commonly involves all frames in feature alignment## easy to cause aligning irrelevant frames with the query. Furthermore## they forcibly map visual features to interval boundaries but ignoring the information gap between them## yielding suboptimal performance. In this study## to reduce distraction from irrelevant frames## we designate an anchor frame as that with the maximum query-frame relevance measured by the established Vision-Language Model. Via similarity comparison between the anchor frame and the others## we produce a semantically compact segment around the anchor frame## which serves as a guide to align features of query and related frames. We observe that such a feature alignment will make similarity cohesive between target frames## which enables us to predict the interval boundaries by a single point detection in the 2D semantic similarity space of frames## thus well bridging the information gap between frame semantics and temporal boundaries. Experimental results across various datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly improves the alignment between queries and video frames while effectively predicting temporal moment boundaries. Especially## on QVHighlights Test and ActivityNet Captions datasets## our proposed approach achieves 3.8% and 7.4% respectively higher than current state-of-the-art R1@.7 performance.

34705,,,Annotation Ambiguity Aware Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation,Despite the remarkable progress of deep learning-based methods in medical image segmentation## their use in clinical practice remains limited for two main reasons. First## obtaining a large medical dataset with precise annotations to train segmentation models is challenging. Secondly## most current segmentation techniques generate a single deterministic segmentation mask for each image. However## in real-world scenarios## there is often significant uncertainty regarding what defines the 'correct' segmentation## and various expert annotators might provide different segmentations for the same image. To tackle both of these problems## we propose Annotation Ambiguity Aware Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation (AmbiSSL). AmbiSSL combines a small amount of multi-annotator labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data to generate diverse and plausible segmentation maps. Our method consists of three key components: (1) The Diverse Pseudo-Label Generation (DPG) module utilizes multiple decoders## created by performing randomized pruning on the original backbone decoder. These pruned decoders enable the generation of a diverse pseudo-label set; (2) a Semi-Supervised Latent Distribution Learning (SSLDL) module constructs a common latent space by utilizing both ground truth annotations and pseudo-label set; and (3) a Cross-Decoder Supervision (CDS) module## which enables pruned decoders to guide each other's learning. We evaluated the proposed method on two publicly available datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that AmbiSSL can generate diverse segmentation maps using only a small amount of labeled data and abundant unlabeled data## offering a more practical solution for medical image segmentation by reducing reliance on large labeled datasets.,0,0

To overcome these limitations## we propose a 3D-Aware 2D Mask Tracking module that uses robust 3D priors from a 2D mask segmentation and tracking foundation model (SAM-2) to ensure consistent object masks across video frames. Rather than merging all visible superpoints across views to create a 3D mask## our 3D Mask Optimization module leverages a dynamic programming algorithm to select an optimal set of views## refining the superpoints to produce a final 3D proposal for each object.

33394,,2505.05505,Apply Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation to Complex Attributes Text-to-3D Generation,Recent text-to-3D generation models have demonstrated remarkable abilities in producing high-quality 3D assets. Despite their great advancements## current models struggle to generate satisfying 3D objects with complex attributes. The difficulty for such complex attributes 3D generation arises from two aspects: (1) existing text-to-3D approaches typically lift text-to-image models to extract semantics via text encoders## while the text encoder exhibits limited comprehension ability for long descriptions## leading to deviated cross-attention focus## subsequently wrong attribute binding in generated results. (2) Objects with complex attributes often exhibit occlusion relationships between different parts## which demands a reasonable generation order as well as explicit disentanglement of different parts to enable structural coherent and attribute following results. Though some works introduce manual efforts to alleviate the above issues## their quality is unstable and highly reliant on manual information. To tackle above problems## we propose a automated method Hierarchical-Chain-of-Generation (HCoG).  It leverages a large language model to analyze the long description## decomposes it into several blocks representing different object parts## and organizes an optimal generation order from in to out according to the occlusion relationship between parts## turning the whole generation process into a hierarchical chain. For optimization within each block## we first generate the necessary components coarsely## then bind their attributes precisely by target region localization and corresponding 3D Gaussian kernel optimization. For optimization between blocks## we introduce Gaussian Extension and Label Elimination to seamlessly generate new parts by extending new Gaussian kernels## re-assigning semantic labels## and eliminating unnecessary kernels## ensuring that only relevant parts are added without disrupting previously optimized parts. Experiments validate HCoG's effectiveness in handling complex attributes 3D assets and witnesses high-quality results. The code is available at https://github.com/Wakals/GASCOL.,0,0

However## existing methods commonly rely on high-quality images for training and often struggle to generate reasonable images when the input images are blemished by artifacts.

32435,,2412.00124,Auto-Encoded Supervision for Perceptual Image Super-Resolution,This work tackles the fidelity objective in the perceptual super-resolution (SR) task. Specifically## we address the shortcomings of pixel-level \mathcal L _\text p  loss (\mathcal L _\text pix ) in the GAN-based SR framework. Since \mathcal L _\text pix  is known to have a trade-off relationship against perceptual quality## prior methods often multiply a small scale factor or utilize low-pass filters. However## this work shows that these circumventions fail to address the fundamental factor that induces blurring. Accordingly## we focus on two points: 1) precisely discriminating the subcomponent of \mathcal L _\text pix  that contributes to blurring## and 2) guiding reconstruction only based on the factor that is free from this trade-off relationship. We show that this can be achieved in a surprisingly simple manner## with an Auto-Encoder (AE) pretrained using \mathcal L _\text pix . Based on this insight## we propose the Auto-Encoded Supervision for Optimal Penalization loss (\mathcal L _\text AESOP )## a novel loss function that measures distance in the AE space (the space after the decoder## not the bottleneck)## rather than in the raw pixel space. By simply substituting \mathcal L _\text pix  with \mathcal L _\text AESOP ## we can provide effective reconstruction guidance without compromising perceptual quality. Designed for simplicity## our method enables easy integration into existing SR frameworks. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of AESOP.,0,0

However## iterative sampling process required for synthesis is very resource-intensive. A line of work  has focused on distilling solutions to probability flow ODEs into few-step student models. Nevertheless## existing methods have been limited by their reliance on the most recent denoised samples as input## rendering them susceptible to exposure bias. To address this limitation## we propose AutoRegressive Distillation (ARD)## a novel approach that leverages the historical trajectory of the ODE to predict future steps. ARD offers two key benefits: 1) it mitigates exposure bias by utilizing a predicted historical trajectory that is less susceptible to accumulated errors## and 2) it leverages the previous history of the ODE trajectory as a more effective source of coarse-grained information. ARD modifies the teacher transformer architecture by adding token-wise time embedding to mark each input from the trajectory history and employs a block-wise causal attention mask for training. Furthermore## incorporating historical inputs only in lower transformer layers enhances performance and efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of ARD in a class-conditioned generation on ImageNet and T2I synthesis. Our model achieves a 5xreduction in FID degradation compared to the baseline methods while requiring only 1.1% extra FLOPs on ImageNet-256. Moreover## ARD reaches FID of 1.84 on ImageNet-256 in merely 4 steps and outperforms the publicly available 1024p text-to-image distilled models in prompt adherence score with a minimal drop in FID compared to the teacher.

However## their effectiveness in long-form video analysis is constrained by limited context windows. Traditional approaches## such as uniform frame sampling## often inevitably allocate resources to irrelevant content## diminishing their effectiveness in real-world scenarios.

32421,,2503.21991,BOOTPLACE: Bootstrapped Object Placement with Detection Transformers,In this paper## we tackle the copy-paste image-to-image composition problem with a focus on object placement learning. Prior methods have leveraged generative models to reduce the reliance for dense supervision. However## this often limits their capacity to model complex data distributions. Alternatively## transformer networks with a sparse contrastive loss have been explored## but their over-relaxed regularization often leads to imprecise object placement. We introduce BOOTPLACE## a novel paradigm that formulates object placement as a placement-by-detection problem. Our approach begins by identifying suitable regions of interest for object placement. This is achieved by training a specialized detection transformer on object-subtracted backgrounds## enhanced with multi-object supervisions. It then semantically associates each target compositing object with detected regions based on their complementary characteristics. Through a boostrapped training approach applied to randomly object-subtracted images## our model enforces meaningful placements through extensive paired data augmentation. Experimental results on established benchmarks demonstrate BOOTPLACE's superior performance in object repositioning## markedly surpassing state-of-the-art baselines on Cityscapes and OPA datasets with notable improvements in IOU scores.

32868,,,BWFormer: Building Wireframe Reconstruction from Airborne LiDAR Point Cloud with Transformer,In this paper## we present BWFormer## a novel Transformer-based model for building wireframe reconstruction from airborne LiDAR point cloud.  The problem is solved in a ground-up manner here by detecting the building corners in 2D## lifting and connecting them in 3D space afterwards with additional data augmentation.Due to the 2.5D  characteristic of the airborne LiDAR point cloud## we simplify the problem by projecting the points on the ground plane to produce a 2D height map. With the height map## a heat map is first generated with pixel-wise corner likelihood to predict the possible 2D corners.Then## 3D corners are predicted by a Transformer-based network with extra height embedding initialization. This 2D-to-3D corner detection strategy reduces the search space significantly. To recover the topological connections among the corners## edges are finally predicted from the height map with the proposed edge attention mechanism## which extracts holistic features and preserves local details simultaneously. In addition## due to the limited datasets in the field and the irregularity of the point clouds## a conditional latent diffusion model for LiDAR scanning simulation is utilized for data augmentation.

The widely used first-order meta-learning algorithms demonstrate strong performance for domain generalization by leveraging the gradient matching theory## which aims to establish balanced parameters across source domains to reduce overfitting to any particular domain. However## our analysis reveals that there are actually numerous directions to achieve gradient matching## with current methods representing just one possible path.

This imbalance can lead to suboptimal optimization## where one objective dominates## thereby reducing overall compression efficiency. To address this challenge## we reformulate R-D optimization as a multi-objective optimization (MOO) problem and introduce two balanced R-D optimization strategies that adaptively adjust gradient updates to achieve more equitable improvements in both rate and distortion. The first proposed strategy utilizes a coarse-to-fine gradient descent approach along standard R-D optimization trajectories## making it particularly suitable for training LIC models from scratch. The second proposed strategy analytically addresses the reformulated optimization as a quadratic programming problem with an equality constraint## which is ideal for fine-tuning existing models. Experimental results demonstrate that both proposed methods enhance the R-D performance of LIC models## achieving around a 2% BD-Rate reduction with acceptable additional training cost## leading to a more balanced and efficient optimization process.

34073,,2503.10080,Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning for Zero-Shot Anomaly Detection,Recently## vision-language models (e.g. CLIP) have demonstrated remarkable performance in zero-shot anomaly detection (ZSAD). By leveraging auxiliary data during training## these models can directly perform cross-category anomaly detection on target datasets## such as detecting defects on industrial product surfaces or identifying tumors in organ tissues. Existing approaches typically construct text prompts through either manual design or the optimization of learnable prompt vectors. However## these methods face several challenges: 1) handcrafted prompts require extensive expert knowledge and trial-and-error; 2) single-form learnable prompts struggle to capture complex anomaly semantics; and 3) an unconstrained prompt space limits generalization to unseen categories. To address these issues## we propose Bayesian Prompt Flow Learning (Bayes-PFL)## which models the prompt space as a learnable probability distribution from a Bayesian perspective. Specifically## a prompt flow module is designed to learn both image-specific and image-agnostic distributions## which are jointly utilized to regularize the text prompt space and improve the model's generalization on unseen categories. These learned distributions are then sampled to generate diverse text prompts## effectively covering the prompt space. Additionally## a residual cross-model attention (RCA) module is introduced to better align dynamic text embeddings with fine-grained image features.

In real-world deployment## however## target distributions often differ from source data## leading to substantial performance degradation. Domain Generalisation (DG) seeks to bridge this gap by enabling models to generalise to Out-Of-Distribution (OOD) data without access to target distributions during training## enhancing robustness to unseen conditions. In this work## we examine the generalisability and robustness of state-of-the-art object detectors under real-world distribution shifts## focusing particularly on spatial domain shifts.

In response## numerous detection methods aim to identify AI-generated images by analyzing generative artifacts. Unfortunately## most detectors quickly become obsolete with the development of generative models. In this paper## we first design a low-level feature extractor that transforms spatial images into feature space## where different source images exhibit distinct distributions. The pretext task for the feature extractor is to distinguish between images that differ only at the pixel level. This image set comprises the original image as well as versions that have been subjected to varying levels of noise and subsequently denoised using a pre-trained diffusion model. We employ the diffusion model as a denoising tool rather than an image generation tool. Then## we frame the AI-generated image detection task as a one-class classification. We estimate the low-level intrinsic feature distribution of real photographic images and identify features that deviate from this distribution as indicators of AI-generated images.

Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) integrate separately pre-trained vision and language components## often using CLIP-ViT as vision backbone.  However## these models frequently encounter a core issue of 'cognitive misalignment' between the vision encoder (VE) and the large language model (LLM). Specifically## the VE's representation of visual information may not fully align with LLM's cognitive framework## leading to a mismatch where visual features exceed the language model's interpretive range. To address this## we investigate how variations in VE representations influence LVLM comprehension## especially when the LLM faces VE-Unknown data--images whose ambiguous visual representations challenge the VE's interpretive precision. Accordingly## we construct a multi-granularity landmark dataset and systematically examine the impact of VE-Known and VE-Unknown data on interpretive abilities. Our results show that VE-Unknown data limits LVLM's capacity for accurate understanding## while VE-Known data## rich in distinctive features## helps reduce cognitive misalignment. Building on these insights## we propose Entity-Enhanced Cognitive Alignment (EECA)## a method that employs multi-granularity supervision to generate visually enriched## well-aligned tokens that not only integrate within the embedding space but also align with the LLM's cognitive framework. This alignment markedly enhances LVLM performance in landmark recognition.

34133,,2411.15232,BiomedCoOp: Learning to Prompt for Biomedical Vision-Language Models,Recent advancements in vision-language models (VLMs)## such as CLIP## have demonstrated substantial success in self-supervised representation learning for vision tasks. However## effectively adapting VLMs to downstream applications remains challenging## as their accuracy often depends on time-intensive and expertise-demanding prompt engineering## while full model fine-tuning is costly. This is particularly true for biomedical images## which## unlike natural images## typically suffer from limited annotated datasets## unintuitive image contrasts## and nuanced visual features. Recent prompt learning techniques## such as Context Optimization (CoOp) intend to tackle these issues## but still fall short in generalizability. Meanwhile## explorations in prompt learning for biomedical image analysis are still highly limited. In this work## we propose BiomedCoOp## a novel prompt learning framework that enables efficient adaptation of BiomedCLIP for accurate and highly generalizable few-shot biomedical image classification. Our approach achieves effective prompt context learning by leveraging semantic consistency with average prompt ensembles from Large Language Models (LLMs) and knowledge distillation with a statistics-based prompt selection strategy. We conducted comprehensive validation of our proposed framework on 11 medical datasets across 9 modalities and 10 organs against existing state-of-the-art methods## demonstrating significant improvements in both accuracy and generalizability.

In this paper## we focus on the more challenging scenarios of article-level visual text rendering and address a novel task of generating high-quality business content## including infographics and slides## based on user provided article-level descriptive prompts and ultra-dense layouts.  The fundamental challenges are twofold: significantly longer context lengths and the scarcity of high-quality business content data. In contrast to most previous works that focus on a limited number of sub-regions and sentence-level prompts## ensuring precise adherence to ultra-dense layouts with tens or even hundreds of sub-regions in business content is far more challenging. We make two key technical contributions: (i) the construction of scalable## high-quality business content dataset## i.e.##Infographics-650K## equipped with ultra-dense layouts and prompts by implementing a layer-wise retrieval-augmented infographic generation scheme; and (ii) a layout-guided cross attention scheme## which injects tens of region-wise prompts into a set of cropped region latent space according to the ultra-dense layouts## and refine each sub-regions flexibly during inference using a layout conditional CFG. We demonstrate the  strong results of our system compared to previous SOTA systems such as Flux and SD3 on our BizEval prompt set. Additionally## we conduct thorough ablation experiments to verify the effectiveness of each component.

35154,,,Black Hole-Driven Identity Absorbing in Diffusion Models,Recent advances in diffusion models have positioned them as powerful generative frameworks for high-resolution image synthesis across diverse domains. The emerging h-space within these models## defined by bottleneck activations in the denoiser## offers promising pathways for semantic image editing similar to GAN latent spaces. However## as demand grows for content erasure and concept removal## privacy concerns highlight the need for identity disentanglement in the latent space of diffusion models. The high dimensional latent space poses challenges for identity removal## as traversing with random or orthogonal directions often leads to semantically unvalidated regions## resulting in unrealistic outputs.To address these issues## we propose Black Hole Driven Identity Absorption (BIA)## a novel approach for identity erasure within the latent space of diffusion models. BIA uses a black hole metaphor## where the latent region representing a specified identity acts as an attractor## drawing in nearby latent points of surrounding identities to wrap the black hole. Instead of relying on random traversals for optimization## BIA employs an identity absorption mechanism by attracting and wrapping nearby validated latent points associated with other identities to achieve a vanishing effect for specified identity.

Most benchmarks focus on typical visual scenarios## making it difficult to discern whether model performance stems from keen perception and reasoning skills## or reliance on pure statistical recall. We argue that by focusing on atypical events in videos## clearer insights can be gained on the core capabilities of VLMs. Explaining and understanding such out-of-distribution events requires models to extend beyond basic pattern recognition and regurgitation of their prior knowledge. To this end## we introduce BlackSwanSuite## a benchmark for evaluating VLMs' ability to reason about unexpected events through abductive and defeasible tasks.

34820,,,Black-Box Forgery Attacks on Semantic Watermarks for Diffusion Models,Integrating watermarking into the generation process of latent diffusion models (LDMs) simplifies detection and attribution of generated content. Semantic watermarks## such as Tree-Rings and Gaussian Shading## represent a novel class of watermarking techniques that are easy to implement and highly robust against various perturbations. However## our work demonstrates a fundamental security vulnerability of semantic watermarks. We show that attackers can leverage unrelated models## even with different latent spaces and architectures (UNet vs DiT)## to perform powerful and realistic forgery attacks. Specifically## we design two watermark forgery attacks. The first \imprints a targeted watermark into real images by manipulating the latent representation of an arbitrary image in an unrelated LDM to get closer to the latent representation of a watermarked image. We also show that this technique can be used for watermark removal. The second attack generates new images with the target watermark by inverting a watermarked image and re-generating it with an arbitrary prompt. Both attacks just need a single reference image with the target watermark. Overall## our findings question the applicability of semantic watermarks by revealing that attackers can easily forge or remove these watermarks under realistic conditions.,0,0

33617,,,Blind Bitstream-corrupted Video Recovery via Metadata-guided Diffusion Model,Bitstream-corrupted video recovery aims to fill in realistic video content due to bitstream corruption during video storage or transmission. Most existing methods typically assume that the predefined masks of the corrupted regions are known in advance. However## manually annotating these masks is laborious and time-consuming## limiting the applicability of existing methods in real-world scenarios. Therefore## we expect to relax this assumption by defining a new blind video recovery setting where the recovery of corrupted regions does not rely on predefined masks. There are two significant challenges in this setting: (i) without predefined masks## how accurately can a model identify the regions requiring recovery? (ii) how to recover contents from extensive and irregular regions## especially when large portions of frames are severely degraded? To address these challenges## we introduce a Metadata-Guided Diffusion Model## dubbed M-GDM. To enable a diffusion model focusing on the corrupted regions## we leverage intrinsic video metadata as a corruption indicator and design a dual-stream metadata encoder. This encoder first embeds the motion vectors and frame types of a video separately and then merges them into a unified metadata representation. The metadata representation will interact with the corrupted latent feature through cross-attention mechanisms at each diffusion step. Meanwhile## to preserve the intact regions## we propose a prior-driven mask predictor that generates pseudo masks for the corrupted regions by leveraging the metadata prior and diffusion prior. These pseudo masks enable the separation and recombination of intact and recovered regions through hard masking. However## imperfections in pseudo mask predictions and hard masking processes often result in boundary artifacts. Thus## we introduce a post-refinement module that refines the hard-masked outputs## enhancing the consistency between intact and recovered regions. Extensive experiment results validate the effectiveness of our method and demonstrate its superiority in the blind video recovery task.,0,0

To address this issue## we propose BlockDance## a training-free approach that explores feature similarities at adjacent time steps to accelerate DiTs. Unlike previous feature-reuse methods that lack tailored reuse strategies for features at different scales## BlockDance prioritizes the identification of the most structurally similar features## referred to as Structurally Similar Spatio-Temporal (STSS) features. These features are primarily located within the structure-focused blocks of the transformer during the later stages of denoising. BlockDance caches and reuses these highly similar features to mitigate redundant computation## thereby accelerating DiTs while maximizing consistency with the generated results of the original model. Furthermore## considering the diversity of generated content and the varying distributions of redundant features## we introduce BlockDance-Ada## a lightweight decision-making network tailored for instance-specific acceleration. BlockDance-Ada dynamically allocates resources and provides superior content quality. Both BlockDance and BlockDance-Ada have proven effective across various generation tasks and models## achieving accelerations between 25% and 50% while maintaining generation quality.,0,0

To address this issue## we explore a common-latent space as an intermediate bridge to mitigate the modality gap. In this work## we propose a novel common spatiotemporal fusion between frame and event modalities for high-dynamic scene optical flow## including visual boundary localization and motion correlation fusion. Specifically## in visual boundary localization## we figure out that frame and event share the similar spatiotemporal gradients## whose similarity distribution is consistent with the extracted boundary distribution. This motivates us to design the common spatiotemporal gradient to constrain the reference boundary localization. In motion correlation fusion## we discover that the frame-based motion possesses spatially dense but temporally discontinuous correlation## while the event-based motion has spatially sparse but temporally continuous correlation. This inspires us to use the reference boundary to guide the complementary motion knowledge fusion between the two modalities. Moreover## common spatiotemporal fusion can not only relieve the cross-modal feature discrepancy## but also make the fusion process interpretable for dense and continuous optical flow. Extensive experiments have been performed to verify the superiority of the proposed method.,0,0

34159,,,Bridging Gait Recognition and Large Language Models Sequence Modeling,Gait sequences exhibit sequential structures and contextual relationships similar to those in natural language## where each element--whether a word or a gait step--is connected to its predecessors and successors. This similarity enables the transformation of gait sequences into 'texts' containing identity-related information. Large Language Models (LLMs)## designed to understand and generate sequential data## can thus be utilized for gait sequence modeling to enhance gait recognition performance. Leveraging these insights## we make a pioneering effort to apply LLMs to gait recognition## which we refer to as GaitLLM.

Previous works attempt to mitigate such conflicts through feature-level manipulation## commonly employing learnable masks to obscure conflicting features within the reference image. However## the inherent complexity of feature spaces poses significant challenges in precise conflict neutralization## thereby leading to uncontrollable results. To this end## this paper proposes the Compositional Conflict Identification and Neutralization (CCIN) framework## which sequentially identifies and neutralizes compositional conflicts for effective CIR. Specifically## CCIN comprises two core modules: 1) Compositional Conflict Identification module## which utilizes LLM-based analysis to identify specific conflicting attributes## and 2) Compositional Conflict Neutralization module## which first generates a kept instruction to preserve non-conflicting attributes## then neutralizes conflicts under collaborative guidance of both the kept and modified instructions. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of CCIN over the state-of-the-arts. Code repository: https://github.com/LikaiTian/CCIN.,0,0
34687,,,CDI: Copyrighted Data Identification in Diffusion Models,Diffusion Models (DMs) benefit from large and diverse datasets for their training. Since this data is often scraped from the Internet without permission from the data owners## this raises concerns about copyright and intellectual property protections. While (illicit) use of data is easily detected for training samples perfectly re-created by a DM at inference time## it is much harder for data owners to verify if their data was used for training when the outputs from the suspect DM are not close replicas. Conceptually## membership inference attacks (MIAs)## which detect if a given data point was used during training## present themselves as a suitable tool to address this challenge. However## we demonstrate that existing MIAs are not strong enough to reliably determine the membership of individual images in large## state-of-the-art DMs. To overcome this limitation## we propose Copyrighted Data Identification (CDI)## a framework for data owners to identify whether their dataset was used to train a given DM. CDI relies on dataset inference techniques## i.e.## instead of using the membership signal from a single data point## CDI leverages the fact that most data owners## such as providers of stock photography## visual media companies## or even individual artists## own datasets with multiple publicly exposed data points which might all be included in the training of a given DM. By selectively aggregating signals from existing MIAs and using new handcrafted methods to extract features from these datasets## feeding them to a scoring model## and applying rigorous statistical testing## CDI allows data owners with as little as 70 data points to identify with a confidence of more than 99% whether their data was used to train a given DM. Thereby## CDI represents a valuable tool for data owners to claim illegitimate use of their copyrighted data.,0,0
34967,,2503.02231,CGMatch: A Different Perspective of Semi-supervised Learning,Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has garnered significant attention due to its ability to leverage limited labeled data and a large amount of unlabeled data to improve model generalization performance. Recent approaches achieve impressive successes by combining ideas from both consistency regularization and pseudo-labeling. However## these methods tend to underperform in the more realistic situations with relatively scarce labeled data. We argue that this issue arises because existing methods rely solely on the model's confidence## making them challenging to accurately assess the model's state and identify unlabeled examples contributing to the training phase when supervision information is limited## especially during the early stages of model training. In this paper## we propose a novel SSL model called CGMatch## which## for the first time## incorporates a new metric known as Count-Gap (CG). We demonstrate that CG is effective in discovering unlabeled examples beneficial for model training. Along with confidence## a commonly used metric in SSL## we propose a fine-grained dynamic selection (FDS) strategy. This strategy dynamically divides the unlabeled dataset into three subsets with different characteristics: easy-to-learn set## ambiguous set## and hard-to-learn set. By selective filtering subsets## and applying corresponding regularization with selected subsets## we mitigate the negative impact of incorrect pseudo-labels on model optimization and generalization. Extensive experimental results on several common SSL benchmarks indicate the effectiveness of CGMatch especially when the labeled data are particularly limited.

However## the rapid pace of knowledge updates in the real world makes offline training of MLLMs costly## and when faced with non-stationary data streams## MLLMs suffer from catastrophic forgetting during learning. In this paper## we propose an MLLMs-based dual momentum Mixture-of-Experts (\texttt CL-MoE ) framework for continual visual question answering. We integrate MLLMs with continual learning to utilize the rich commonsense knowledge in LLMs.We introduce a Dual-Router MoE (RMoE) to select the global and local experts using task-level and instance-level routers## to robustly assign weights to the experts most appropriate for the task. Then## we design a dynamic Momentum MoE (MMoE) to update the parameters of experts dynamically based on the relationships between the experts and tasks## so that the model can absorb new knowledge while maintaining existing knowledge.

Through retrieval and classification tasks## we quantify these biases across multiple CLIP variants and trace their origins to CLIP's training process## supported by analyses of the LAION dataset and training progression. Our image-text matching experiments show substantial performance drops when object size or token order changes## underscoring CLIP's instability with rephrased but semantically similar captions.

33346,,,CLIP is Almost All You Need: Towards Parameter-Efficient Scene Text Retrieval without OCR,Scene Text Retrieval (STR) seeks to identify all images containing a given query string. Existing methods typically rely on an explicit Optical Character Recognition (OCR) process of text spotting or localization## which is susceptible to complex pipelines and accumulated errors. To settle this## we resort to the Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) models## which have demonstrated the capacity to perceive and understand scene text## making it possible to achieve strictly OCR-free STR. From the perspective of parameter-efficient transfer learning## a lightweight visual position adapter is proposed to provide a positional information complement for the visual encoder.

35254,,2503.03613,CLIP is Strong Enough to Fight Back: Test-time Counterattacks towards Zero-shot Adversarial Robustness of CLIP,Despite its prevalent use in image-text matching tasks in a zero-shot manner## CLIP has been shown to be highly vulnerable to adversarial perturbations added onto images. Recent studies propose to finetune the vision encoder of CLIP with adversarial samples generated on the fly## and show improved robustness against adversarial attacks on a spectrum of downstream datasets## a property termed as zero-shot robustness. In this paper## we show that malicious perturbations that seek to maximise the classification loss lead to `falsely stable' images## and propose to leverage the pre-trained vision encoder of CLIP to counterattack such adversarial images during inference to achieve robustness. Our paradigm is simple and training-free## providing the first method to defend CLIP from adversarial attacks at test time## which is orthogonal to existing methods aiming to boost zero-shot adversarial robustness of CLIP. We conduct experiments across 16 classification datasets## and demonstrate stable and consistent gains compared to test-time defence methods adapted from existing adversarial robustness studies that do not rely on external networks## without noticeably impairing performance on clean images. We also show that our paradigm can be employed on CLIP models that have been adversarially finetuned to further enhance their robustness at test time. Our code will be released.,0,0
32494,,,CLIP-driven Coarse-to-fine Semantic Guidance for Fine-grained Open-set Semi-supervised Learning,Fine-grained open-set semi-supervised learning (OSSL) investigates a practical scenario where unlabeled data may contain fine-grained out-of-distribution (OOD) samples. Due to the subtle visual differences among in-distribution (ID) samples## as well as between ID and OOD samples## it is extremely challenging to separate the ID and OOD samples. Due to the subtle visual differences among in-distribution (ID) and OOD samples. Recent Vision-Language Models## such as CLIP## have shown excellent generalization capabilities. However## it tends to focus on general attributes## and thus is insufficient to distinguish the fine-grained details. To tackle the issues## in this paper## we propose a novel CLIP-driven coarse-to-fine semantic-guided framework## named CFSG-CLIP## to progressively focus on the distinctive fine-grained clues.  Specifically## CFSG-CLIP comprises a coarse-guidance branch and a fine-guidance branch derived from the pre-trained CLIP model. In the coarse-guidance branch## we design a semantic filtering module to initially filter and highlight local visual features guided by cross-modality features. Then## in the fine-guidance branch## we further design a visual-semantic injection strategy## which embeds category-related visual cues into the visual encoder to further refine the local visual features. By the designed dual-guidance framework## local subtle cues are progressively discovered to distinct the subtle difference between ID and OOD samples.

32653,,,CLOC: Contrastive Learning for Ordinal Classification with Multi-Margin N-pair Loss,In ordinal classification## misclassifying neighboring ranks is common## yet the consequences of these errors are not the same.For example## misclassifying benign tumor categories is less consequential## compared to an error at the pre-cancerous to cancerous threshold## which could profoundly influence treatment choices. Despite this## existing ordinal classification methods do not account for the varying importance of these margins## treating all neighboring classes as equally significant. To address this limitation## we propose CLOC## a new margin-based contrastive learning method for ordinal classification that learns an ordered representation based on the optimization of multiple margins with a novel multi-margin n-pair loss (MMNP).CLOC enables flexible decision boundaries across key adjacent categories## facilitating smooth transitions between classes and reducing the risk of overfitting to biases present in the training data.We provide empirical discussion regarding the properties of MMNP and show experimental results on five real-world image datasets (Adience## Historical Colour Image Dating## Knee Osteoarthritis## Indian Diabetic Retinopathy Image## and Breast Carcinoma Subtyping) and one synthetic dataset simulating clinical decision bias.Our results demonstrate that CLOC outperforms existing ordinal classification methods and show the interpretability and controllability of CLOC in learning meaningful## ordered representations that align with clinical and practical needs.,0,0
35017,,2503.02593,CMMLoc: Advancing Text-to-PointCloud Localization with Cauchy-Mixture-Model Based Framework,The goal of point cloud localization based on linguistic description is to identify a 3D position using textual description in large urban environments## which has potential applications in various fields## such as determining the location for vehicle pickup or goods delivery. Ideally## for a textual description and its corresponding 3D location## the objects around the 3D location should be fully described in the text description. However## in practical scenarios## e.g.## vehicle pickup## passengers usually describe only the part of the most significant and nearby surroundings instead of the entire environment. In response to this partially relevant challenge## we propose CMMLoc## an uncertainty-aware Cauchy-Mixture-Model (CMM) based framework for text-to-point-cloud Localization. To model the uncertain semantic relations between text and point cloud## we integrate CMM constraints as a prior during the interaction between the two modalities.

32790,,,CTRL-O: Language-Controllable Object-Centric Visual Representation Learning,Object-centric representation learning aims to decompose visual scenes into fixed-size vectors called 'slots' or 'object files'## where each slot captures a distinct object. Current state-of-the-art object-centric models have shown remarkable success in object discovery in diverse domains including complex real-world scenes. However## these models suffer from a key limitation: they lack controllability. Specifically## current object-centric models learn representations based on their preconceived understanding of objects and parts## without allowing user input to guide which objects are represented. Introducing controllability into object-centric models could unlock a range of useful capabilities## such as the ability to extract instance-specific representations from a scene. In this work## we propose a novel approach for user-directed control over slot representations by conditioning slots on language descriptions. The proposed ConTRoLlable Object-centric representation learning approach## which we term CTRL-O## achieves targeted object-language binding in complex real-world scenes without requiring mask supervision. Next## we apply these controllable slot representations on two downstream vision language tasks: text-to-image generation and visual question answering.

34391,,2503.01323,CacheQuant: Comprehensively Accelerated Diffusion Models,Diffusion models have gradually gained prominence in the field of image synthesis## showcasing remarkable generative capabilities. Nevertheless## the slow inference and complex networks## resulting from redundancy at both temporal and structural levels## hinder their low-latency applications in real-world scenarios. Current acceleration methods for diffusion models focus separately on temporal and structural levels. However## independent optimization at each level to further push the acceleration limits results in significant performance degradation. On the other hand## integrating optimizations at both levels can compound the acceleration effects. Unfortunately## we find that the optimizations at these two levels are not entirely orthogonal. Performing separate optimizations and then simply integrating them results in unsatisfactory performance. To tackle this issue## we propose CacheQuant## a novel training-free paradigm that comprehensively accelerates diffusion models by jointly optimizing model caching and quantization techniques. Specifically## we employ a dynamic programming approach to determine the optimal cache schedule## in which the properties of caching and quantization are carefully considered to minimize errors. Additionally## we propose decoupled error correction to further mitigate the coupled and accumulated errors step by step. Experimental results show that CacheQuant achieves a 5.18xspeedup and 4xcompression for Stable Diffusion on MS-COCO## with only a 0.02 loss in CLIP score.,0,0
33781,,2502.02588,Calibrated Multi-Preference Optimization for Aligning Diffusion Models,Aligning text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models with prefer-ence optimization is valuable for human-annotated datasets## but the heavy cost of manual data collection limits scalability. Using reward models offers an alternative## however## current preference optimization methods fall short in exploiting the rich information## as they only consider pairwise preference distribution. Furthermore## they lack generalization to multi-preference scenarios and struggle to handle inconsistencies between rewards. To address this## we present Calibrated Preference Optimization (CaPO)## a novel method to align T2I diffusion models by incorporating the general preference from multiple reward models without human annotated data. The core of our approach involves a reward calibration method to approximate the general preference by computing the expected win-rate against the samples generated by the pretrained models. Additionally## we propose a frontier-based pair selection method that effectively manages the multi-preference distribution by selecting pairs from Pareto frontiers. Finally## we use regression loss to fine-tune diffusion models to match the difference between calibrated rewards of a selected pair.

34416,,2407.07174,CamFreeDiff: Camera-free Image to Panorama Generation with Diffusion Model,This paper introduces Camera-free Diffusion (CamFreeDiff) model for 360^\circ image outpainting from a single camera-free image and text description. This method distinguishes itself from existing strategies## such as MVDiffusion## by eliminating the requirement for predefined camera poses. CamFreeDiff seamlessly incorporates a mechanism for predicting homography within the multi-view diffusion framework. The key component of our approach is to formulate camera estimation by directly predicting the homography transformation from the input view to the predefined canonical view. In contrast to the direct two-stage approach of image transformation and outpainting## CamFreeDiff utilizes predicted homography to establish point-level correspondences between the input view and the target panoramic view. This enables consistency through correspondence-aware attention## which is learned in a fully differentiable manner. Qualitative and quantitative experimental results demonstrate the strong robustness and performance of CamFreeDiff for 360^\circ image outpainting in the challenging context of camera-free inputs.,0,0
34611,,,CamPoint: Boosting Point Cloud Segmentation with Virtual Camera,Local features aggregation and global information perception are the fundamental to point cloud segmentation. However## existing works often fall short in effectively identifying semantic relevant neighbors and face challenges in endowing each point with high-level information. Here## we propose CamPoint## an innovative method that employs virtual cameras to solve above problems. The core of CamPoint lies in introducing the novel camera visibility feature for points## where each dimension encodes the visibility of that point from a specific camera. Leveraging this feature## we propose the camera perspective slice distance for accurate relevant neighbor searching and design the camera parameter embedding to deliver rich feature representations for global interaction. Specifically## the camera perspective slice distance between two points is defined as a similarity metric derived from their camera visibility features## whereby an increased number of shared cameras observing both points corresponds to a reduced distance between them. To effectively facilitate global semantic perception## we assign each camera an optimizable embedding and then integrate these embeddings into the original spatial features based on visibility attributes## thereby obtaining high-level features enriched with camera priors. Additionally## the state space model characterized by linear computational complexity is employed as the operator to achieve global learning with efficiency. Comprehensive experiments on multiple datasets shows that our CamPoint surpasses the current state-of-the-art in multiple datasets## achieving low training cost and fast inference speed.,0,0

Dataset and Benchmark for Photographic Image Composition Embedding and Understanding,With the rapid growth of social media and digital photography## visually appealing images have become essential for effective communication and emotional engagement.

32590,,2503.18507,Can Text-to-Video Generation help Video-Language Alignment?,Recent video-language alignment models are trained on sets of videos## each with an associated positive caption and a negative caption generated by large language models. A problem with this procedure is that negative captions may introduce linguistic biases## i.e.## concepts are seen only as negatives and never associated with a video.

In this work## we study whether synthetic videos can help to overcome this issue. Our preliminary analysis with multiple generators shows that## while promising on some tasks## synthetic videos harm the performance of the model on others. We hypothesize this issue is linked to noise (semantic and visual) in the generated videos and develop a method## SynViTA## that accounts for those. SynViTA dynamically weights the contribution of each synthetic video based on how similar its target caption is w.r.t. the real counterpart. Moreover## a semantic consistency loss makes the model focus on fine-grained differences across captions## rather than differences in video appearance.

A key challenge in caricature generation is two-fold: the scarcity of high-quality caricature data and the difficulty in enabling precise creative control over the exaggeration process while maintaining identity. Prior approaches either require large-scale caricature and photo data or lack intuitive mechanisms for users to guide the deformation without losing identity. We address the data scarcity by synthesising training data through Thin Plate Spline (TPS) deformation of standard face images. For creative control## we design a Bezier curve interface where users can easily manipulate facial features## with these edits then driving TPS transformations at inference time.

As the practical applications of VLMs become increasingly widespread## their potential safety and robustness issues raise concerns that adversaries may evade the system and cause these models to generate toxic content through malicious attacks. Therefore## evaluating the robustness of open-source VLMs against adversarial attacks has garnered growing attention## with transfer-based attacks as a representative black-box attacking strategy.

34077,,2503.18803,Change3D: Revisiting Change Detection and Captioning from A Video Modeling Perspective,In this paper## we present Change3D## a framework that reconceptualizes the change detection and captioning tasks through video modeling. Recent methods have achieved remarkable success by regarding each pair of bi-temporal images as separate frames. They employ a shared-weight image encoder to extract spatial features and then use a change extractor to capture differences between the two images. However## image feature encoding## being a task-agnostic process## cannot attend to changed regions effectively. Furthermore## different change extractors designed for various change detection and captioning tasks make it difficult to have a unified framework. To tackle these challenges## Change3D regards the bi-temporal images as comprising two frames akin to a tiny video. By integrating learnable perception frames between the bi-temporal images## a video encoder enables the perception frames to interact with the images directly and perceive their differences. Therefore## we can get rid of the intricate change extractors## providing a unified framework for different change detection and captioning tasks. We verify Change3D on multiple tasks## encompassing change detection (including binary change detection## semantic change detection## and building damage assessment) and change captioning## across eight standard benchmarks. Without bells and whistles## this simple yet effective framework can achieve superior performance with an ultra-light video model comprising only ~6%-13% of the parameters and ~8%-34% of the FLOPs compared to state-of-the-art methods.

However## the lack of context-rich datasets limits AI applications in this field. Existing datasets rely on overly generic tracking formalizations that fail to capture surgical-specific dynamics## such as tools moving out of the camera's view or exiting the body.

35194,,2412.00175,Circumventing Shortcuts in Audio-visual Deepfake Detection Datasets with Unsupervised Learning,Good datasets are essential for developing and benchmarking any machine learning system. Their importance is even more extreme for safety critical applications such as deepfake detection - the focus of this paper. Here we reveal that two of the most widely used audio-video deepfake datasets suffer from a previously unidentified spurious feature: the leading silence. Fake videos start with a very brief moment of silence and## on the basis of this feature alone## we can separate the real and fake samples almost perfectly. As such## previous audio-only and audio-video models exploit the presence of silence in the fake videos and consequently perform worse when the leading silence is removed. To circumvent latching on such an unwanted artifact and possibly other unrevealed ones## we propose a shift from supervised to unsupervised learning by training models exclusively on real data. We show that by aligning self-supervised audio-video representations we remove the risk of relying on dataset-specific biases and improve robustness in deepfake detection.,0,0

32782,,2411.16738,Classifier-Free Guidance Inside the Attraction Basin May Cause Memorization,Diffusion models are prone to exactly reproduce images from the training data. This exact reproduction of the training data is concerning as it can lead to copyright infringement and/or leakage of privacy-sensitive information. In this paper## we present a novel perspective on the memorization phenomenon and propose a simple yet effective approach to mitigate it. We argue that memorization occurs because of an attraction basin in the denoising process which steers the diffusion trajectory towards a memorized image. However## this can be mitigated by guiding the diffusion trajectory away from the attraction basin by not applying classifier-free guidance until an ideal transition point occurs from which classifier-free guidance is applied. This leads to the generation of non-memorized images that are high in image quality and well-aligned with the conditioning mechanism. To further improve on this## we present a new guidance technique## opposite guidance## that escapes the attraction basin sooner in the denoising process. We demonstrate the existence of attraction basins in various scenarios in which memorization occurs## and we show that our proposed approach successfully mitigates memorization.,0,0

35101,,,Classifier-to-Bias: Toward Unsupervised Automatic Bias Detection for Visual Classifiers,A person downloading a pre-trained model from the web should be aware of its biases. Existing approaches for bias identification rely on datasets containing labels for the task of interest## something that a non-expert may not have access to## or may not have the necessary resources to collect: this greatly limits the number of tasks where model biases can be identified. In this work## we present Classifier-to-Bias (C2B)## the first bias discovery framework that works without access to any labeled data: it only relies on a textual description of the classification task to identify biases in the target classification model. This description is fed to a large language model to generate bias proposals and corresponding captions depicting biases together with task-specific target labels. A retrieval model collects images for those captions## which are then used to assess the accuracy of the model w.r.t. the given biases. C2B is training-free## does not require any annotations## has no constraints on the list of biases## and can be applied to any pre-trained model on any classification task. Experiments on two publicly available datasets show that C2B discovers biases beyond those of the original datasets and outperforms a recent state-of-the-art bias detection baseline that relies on task-specific annotations## being a promising first step toward addressing task-agnostic unsupervised bias detection.,0,0
33497,,2412.03439,CleanDIFT: Diffusion Features without Noise,Internal features from large-scale pre-trained diffusion models have recently been established as powerful semantic descriptors for a wide range of downstream tasks.

We address this issue by introducing a lightweight## unsupervised fine-tuning method that enables diffusion backbones to provide high-quality## noise-free semantic features. We show that these features readily outperform previous diffusion features by a wide margin in a wide variety of extraction setups and downstream tasks## offering better performance than even ensemble-based methods at a fraction of the cost.,0,0
33965,,2503.13107,ClearSight: Visual Signal Enhancement for Object Hallucination Mitigation in Multimodal Large Language Models,Contrastive decoding strategies are widely used to mitigate object hallucinations in multimodal large language models (MLLMs). By reducing over-reliance on language priors## these strategies ensure that generated content remains closely grounded in visual inputs## producing contextually accurate outputs. Since contrastive decoding requires no additional training or external tools## it offers both computational efficiency and versatility## making it highly attractive. However## these methods present two main limitations: (1) bluntly suppressing language priors can compromise coherence and accuracy of generated content## and (2) processing contrastive inputs adds computational load## significantly slowing inference speed. To address these challenges## we propose Visual Amplification Fusion (VAF)## a plug-and-play technique that enhances attention to visual signals within the model's middle layers## where modality fusion predominantly occurs.

The study on capturing climbing motion## an off-ground motion## is sparse. This is partly due to the limited availability of climbing motion datasets## especially large-scale and challenging 3D labeled datasets. To address the insufficiency of climbing motion datasets## we collect AscendMotion## a large-scale well-annotated## and challenging climbing motion dataset. It consists of 412k RGB## LiDAR frames## and IMU measurements## which includes the challenging climbing motions of 22 professional climbing coaches across 12 different rocks. Capturing the climbing motions is challenging as it requires precise recovery of not only the complex pose but also the global position of climbers. Although multiple global HMR methods have been proposed## they cannot faithfully capture climbing motions. To address the limitations of HMR methods for climbing## we propose ClimbingCap## a motion recovery method that reconstructs continuous 3D human climbing motion in a global coordinate system. One key insight is to use the RGB and the LiDAR modalities to separately reconstruct motions in camera coordinates and global coordinates and optimize them jointly. We demonstrate the quality of the AscendMotion dataset and present promising results from ClimbingCap.

34861,,,Closest Neighbors are Harmful for Lightweight Masked Auto-encoders,Learning the visual representation via masked auto-encoder (MAE) training has been proven to be a powerful technique. Transferring the pre-trained vision transformer (ViT) to downstream tasks leads to superior performance compared to conventional task-by-task supervised learning.  Recent research works on MAE focus on large-sized vision transformers (>50 million parameters) with outstanding performance. However## improving the generality of the under-parametrized lightweight model has been widely ignored.  In practice## downstream applications are commonly intended for resource-constrained platforms## where large-scale ViT cannot easily meet the resource budget. Current lightweight MAE training heavily relies on knowledge distillation with a pre-trained teacher## whereas the root cause behind the poor performance remains under-explored.  Motivated by that## this paper first introduces the concept of 'closest neighbor patch' to characterize the local semantics among the input tokens. Our discovery shows that the lightweight model failed to distinguish different local information## leading to aliased understanding and poor accuracy. Motivated by this finding## we propose NoR-MAE## a novel MAE training algorithm for lightweight vision transformers. NoR-MAE elegantly repels the semantic aliasing between patches and their closest neighboring patch (semantic centroid) with negligible training cost overhead. With the ViT-Tiny model## NoR-MAE achieves up to 7.22%/3.64% accuracy improvements on ImageNet-100/ImageNet-1K datasets## as well as up to 5.13% accuracy improvements in tested downstream tasks. https://github.com/SeoLabCornell/NoR-MAE,0,0

However## existing collaborative perception methods face a dilemma between communication efficiency and perception accuracy. To address this issue## we propose a novel communication-efficient collaborative perception framework based on supply-demand awareness and intermediate-late hybridization## dubbed as CoSDH. By modeling the supply-demand relationship between agents## the framework refines the selection of collaboration regions## reducing unnecessary communication cost while maintaining accuracy.

In this paper## we introduce CoSER## a novel consistent dense Multiview Text-to-Image Generator for Text-to-3D## achieving both efficiency and quality by meticulously learning neighbor-view coherence and further alleviating ambiguity through the swift traversal of all views. For achieving neighbor-view consistency## each viewpoint densely interacts with adjacent viewpoints to perceive the global spatial structure## and aggregates information along motion paths explicitly defined by physical principles to refine details. To further enhance cross-view consistency and alleviate content drift## CoSER rapidly scan all views in spiral bidirectional manner to aware holistic information and then scores each point based on semantic material. Subsequently## we conduct weighted down-sampling along the spatial dimension based on scores## thereby facilitating prominent information fusion across all views with lightweight computation.

Current benchmarks provide insightful analysis of VLMs in tasks involving complex visual instructions following## multi-image understanding and spatial reasoning. However## they usually focus on spatially irrelevant images or discrete images captured from varied viewpoints. The compositional characteristic of images captured from a static viewpoint remains underestimated. We term this characteristic as Continuous Space Perception.

Previous works  focus on improving visual feature fusion and reasoning from multiple image levels.  Although it is non-trivial to deduce a person's emotion by  integrating multi-level feature (head## body and context)## the emotion recognition results of each level is usually different from one another## which creates inconsistency in the prevailing feature alignment method and decrease recognition performance. In this work## we propose a multi-level image feature refinement method for emotion recognition (CocoER) to mitigate the impact caused by conflicting results from  multi-level recognition.

To this end## we propose Code-as-Monitor (CaM)## a novel paradigm leveraging the vision-language model (VLM) for both open-set reactive and proactive failure detection. The core of our method is to formulate both tasks as a unified set of spatio-temporal constraint satisfaction problems and use VLM-generated code to evaluate them for real-time monitoring. To enhance the accuracy and efficiency of monitoring## we further introduce constraint elements that abstract constraint-related entities or their parts into compact geometric elements. This approach offers greater generality## simplifies tracking## and facilitates constraint-aware visual programming by leveraging these elements as visual prompts. Experiments show that CaM achieves a 28.7% higher success rate and reduces execution time by 31.8% under severe disturbances compared to baselines across three simulators and a real-world setting.

Previous PEFT methods are primarily designed from a tensor-decomposition perspective that tries to effectively tune the linear transformation by finding the smallest subset of parameters to train. Our study adopts an orthogonal view by representing the attention operation as a graph convolution and formulating the multi-head attention maps as a convolutional filter subspace## with each attention map as a subspace element. In this paper## we propose to tune the large pre-trained transformers by learning a small set of combination coefficients that construct a more expressive filter subspace from the original multi-head attention maps. We show analytically and experimentally that the tuned filter subspace can effectively expand the feature space of the multi-head attention and further enhance the capacity of transformers. We further stabilize the fine-tuning with a residual parameterization of the tunable subspace coefficients## and enhance the generalization with a regularization design by directly applying dropout on the tunable coefficient during training. The tunable coefficients take a tiny number of parameters and can be combined with previous PEFT methods in a plug-and-play manner. Extensive experiments show that our approach achieves superior performances than PEFT baselines with neglectable additional parameters.,0,0
33109,,,Coherent 3D Portrait Video Reconstruction via Triplane Fusion,Recent breakthroughs in single-image 3D portrait reconstruction have enabled telepresence systems to stream 3D portrait videos from a single camera in real-time## democratizing telepresence. However## per-frame 3D reconstruction exhibits temporal inconsistency and forgets the user's appearance. On the other hand## self-reenactment methods can render coherent 3D portraits by driving a 3D avatar built from a single reference image but fail to faithfully preserve the user's per-frame appearance (e.g.## instantaneous facial expressions and lighting). As a result## neither of these two frameworks is an ideal solution for democratized 3D telepresence. In this work## we address this dilemma and propose a novel solution that maintains both coherent identity and dynamic per-frame appearance to enable the best possible realism. To this end## we propose a new fusion-based method that takes the best of both worlds by fusing a canonical 3D prior from a reference view with dynamic appearance from per-frame input views## producing temporally stable 3D videos with faithful reconstruction of the user's per-frame appearance.

33834,,2503.17093,ColabSfM: Collaborative Structure-from-Motion by Point Cloud Registration,Structure-from-Motion (SfM) is the task of estimating 3D structure and camera poses from images. We define Collaborative SfM (ColabSfM) as sharing distributed SfM reconstructions. Sharing maps requires estimating a joint reference frame## which is typically referred to as registration. However## there is a lack of scalable methods and training datasets for registering SfM reconstructions. In this paper## we tackle this challenge by proposing the scalable task of point cloud registration for SfM reconstructions. We find that current registration methods cannot register SfM point clouds when trained on existing datasets. To this end## we propose a SfM registration dataset generation pipeline## leveraging partial reconstructions from synthetically generated camera trajectories for each scene.

This paradigm offers substantial improvements in efficiency## scalability## and zero-shot generalization. Yet## the inherently coarse-to-fine nature of VAR introduces a prolonged token sequence## leading to prohibitive memory consumption and computational redundancies. To overcome these bottlenecks## we propose *Collaborative Decoding* (CoDe)## a novel decoding strategy tailored to the VAR framework. CoDe capitalizes on two critical observations: the substantially reduced parameter demands at larger scales and the exclusive generation patterns across different scales. Based on these insights## we partition the multi-scale inference process into a seamless collaboration between a large model and a small model. The large model serves as the 'drafter'## specializing in generating low-frequency content at smaller scales## while the smaller model serves as the 'refiner'## solely focusing on predicting high-frequency details at larger scales. This collaboration yields remarkable efficiency with minimal impact on quality: CoDe achieves a 1.7x speedup## slashes memory usage by around 50%## and preserves image quality with only a negligible FID increase from 1.95 to 1.98.

CompGS first automatically decomposes 3D Gaussians into distinct entity parts## enabling optimization at both the entity and composition levels. Additionally## CompGS optimizes across objects of varying scales by dynamically adjusting the spatial parameters of each entity## enhancing the generation of fine-grained details## particularly in smaller entities. Qualitative comparisons and quantitative evaluations on T3Bench demonstrate the effectiveness of CompGS in generating compositional 3D objects with superior image quality and semantic alignment over existing methods.

In this work## we address the problem of multi-object orientation control in text-to-image diffusion models. This enables the generation of diverse multi-object scenes with precise orientation control for each object. The key idea is to condition the diffusion model with a set of orientation-aware compass tokens## one for each object## along with text tokens. A light-weight encoder network predicts these compass tokens taking object orientation as the input. The model is trained on a synthetic dataset of procedurally generated scenes## each containing one or two 3D-assets on a plain background.

To mitigate this## we intervene in the generation process and constrain the cross-attention maps of each compass token to its corresponding object regions. The trained model is able to achieve precise orientation control for a) complex objects not seen during training## and b) multi-object scenes with more than two objects## indicating strong generalization capabilities. Further## when combined with personalization methods## our method precisely controls the orientation of the new object in diverse contexts.

This allows more control for artists and enables novel object compositions by combining distinctive object parts. PartComposer first localizes object parts by denoising the object region from a specific diffusion process. This enables each part token to be localized to the right region. After obtaining part masks## we run a localized diffusion process in each part region based on fine-grained part attributes and combine them to produce the final image. All stages of PartComposer are based on repurposing a pre-trained diffusion model## which enables it to generalize across domains.

In this paper## we introduce a comprehensive information bottleneck (CoIBA)## which discovers the relevant information in each targeted layer to explain the decision-making process. Our core idea is applying information bottleneck in multiple targeted layers to estimate the comprehensive information by sharing a parametric damping ratio across the layers. Leveraging this shared ratio complements the over-compressed information to discover the omitted clues of the decision by sharing the relevant information across the targeted layers. We suggest the variational approach to fairly reflect the relevant information of each layer by upper bounding layer-wise information. Therefore## CoIBA guarantees that the discarded activation is unnecessary in every targeted layer to make a decision.

33146,,2503.19357,Correcting Deviations from Normality: A Reformulated Diffusion Model for Multi-Class Unsupervised Anomaly Detection,Recent advances in diffusion models have spurred research into their application for Reconstruction-based unsupervised anomaly detection. However## these methods may struggle with maintaining structural integrity and recovering the anomaly-free content of abnormal regions## especially in multi-class scenarios. Furthermore## diffusion models are inherently designed to generate images from pure noise and struggle to selectively alter anomalous regions of an image while preserving normal ones. This leads to potential degradation of normal regions during reconstruction## hampering the effectiveness of anomaly detection.  This paper introduces a reformulation of the standard diffusion model geared toward selective region alteration## allowing the accurate identification of anomalies. By modeling anomalies as noise in the latent space## our proposed Deviation correction diffusion (DeCo-Diff) model preserves the normal regions and encourages transformations exclusively on anomalous areas. This selective approach enhances the reconstruction quality## facilitating effective unsupervised detection and localization of anomaly regions. Comprehensive evaluations demonstrate the superiority of our method in accurately identifying and localizing anomalies in complex images## with pixel-level AUPRC improvements of 11-14% over state-of-the-art models on well-known anomaly detection datasets.

However## recent studies have overemphasized co-occurrence relationships among labels## which can lead to overfitting risk on this overemphasis## resulting in suboptimal models. To tackle this problem## we advocate for balancing correlative and discriminative relationships among labels to mitigate the risk of overfitting and enhance model performance. To this end## we propose the Multi-Label Visual Prompt Tuning framework## a novel and parameter-efficient method that groups classes into multiple class subsets according to label co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity relationships## and then models them respectively to balance the two relationships. In this work## since each group contains multiple classes## multiple prompt tokens are adopted within Vision Transformer (ViT) to capture the correlation or discriminative label relationship within each group## and effectively learn correlation or discriminative representations for class subsets. On the other hand## each group contains multiple group-aware visual representations that may correspond to multiple classes## and the mixture of experts (MoE) model can cleverly assign them from the group-aware to the label-aware## adaptively obtaining label-aware representation## which is more conducive to classification. Experiments on multiple benchmark datasets show that our proposed approach achieves competitive results and outperforms SOTA methods on multiple pre-trained models.,0,0

33205,,,Critic-V: VLM Critics Help Catch VLM Errors in Multimodal Reasoning,Vision-language models (VLMs) have shown remarkable advancements in multimodal reasoning tasks. However## they still often generate inaccurate or irrelevant responses due to issues like hallucinated image understandings or unrefined reasoning paths. To address these challenges## we introduce Critic-V## a novel framework inspired by the Actor-Critic paradigm to boost the reasoning capability of VLMs. This framework decouples the reasoning process and critic process by integrating two independent components: the Reasoner## which generates reasoning paths based on visual and textual inputs## and the Critic## which provides constructive critique to refine these paths. In this approach## the Reasoner generates reasoning responses according to text prompts## which can evolve iteratively as a policy based on feedback from the Critic. This interaction process was theoretically driven by a reinforcement learning framework where the Critic offers natural language critiques instead of scalar rewards## enabling more nuanced feedback to boost the Reasoner's capability on complex reasoning tasks. The Critic model is trained using Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)## leveraging a preference dataset of critiques ranked by Rule-based Reward (RBR) to enhance its critic capabilities. Evaluation results show that the Critic-V framework significantly outperforms existing methods## including GPT-4V## on 5 out of 8 benchmarks## especially regarding reasoning accuracy and efficiency. Combining a dynamic text-based policy for the Reasoner and constructive feedback from the preference-optimized Critic enables a more reliable and context-sensitive multimodal reasoning process.

34204,,,Cross-Rejective Open-Set SAR Image Registration,Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image registration is an essential upstream task in geoscience applications## in which pre-detected keypoints from two images are employed as observed objects to seek matched-point pairs. In general## the registration is regarded as a typical closed-set classification## which forces each keypoint to be classified into the given classes## but ignoring an essential issue that numerous redundant keypoints are beyond the given classes## which unavoidably results in capturing incorrect matched-point pairs. Based on this## we propose a Cross-Rejective Open-set SAR Image Registration (CroR-OSIR) method. In this work## these redundant keypoints are regarded as out-of-distribution (OOD) samples## and we formulate the registration as a special open-set task with two modules: supervised contrastive feature-tuning and cross-rejective open-set recognition (CroR-OSR). Unlike traditional open-set recognition## all samples## including OOD samples## are available in the CroR-OSR module. CroR-OSR conducts the closed-set classifications in individual open-set domains from two images## meanwhile employing the cross-domain rejection during training## to exclude these OOD samples based on confidence and consistency. Moreover## a new supervised contrastive tuning strategy is incorporated for feature-tuning. Especially## the cross-domain estimation labels obtained by CroR-OSR are fed back to the feature-tuning module for feature-tuning## to enhance feature discriminability.

However## DFER datasets contain a substantial amount of noisy samples## and few have addressed the issue of handling this noise. We identified two types of noise: one is caused by low-quality data resulting from factors such as occlusion## dim lighting## and blurriness; the other arises from mislabeled data due to annotation bias by annotators.

32774,,,DAMM-Diffusion: Learning Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Diffusion Model for Nanoparticles Distribution Prediction,The prediction of nanoparticles (NPs) distribution is crucial for the diagnosis and treatment of tumors. Recent studies indicate that the heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) highly affects the distribution of NPs across tumors. Hence## it has become a research hotspot to generate the NPs distribution by the aid of multi-modal TME components. However## the distribution divergence among multi-modal TME components may cause side effects i.e.## the best uni-modal model may outperform the joint generative model. To address the above issues## we propose a \Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Diffusion model (i.e.## DAMM-Diffusion) to adaptively generate the prediction results from uni-modal and multi-modal branches in a unified network. In detail## the uni-modal branch is composed of the U-Net architecture while the multi-modal branch extends it by introducing two novel fusion modules i.e.## Multi-Modal Fusion Module (MMFM) and Uncertainty-Aware Fusion Module (UAFM). Specifically## the MMFM is proposed to fuse features from multiple modalities## while the UAFM module is introduced to learn the uncertainty map for cross-attention computation. Following the individual prediction results from each branch## the Divergence-Aware Multi-Modal Predictor (DAMMP) module is proposed to assess the consistency of multi-modal data with the uncertainty map## which determines whether the final prediction results come from  multi-modal or uni-modal predictions. We predict the NPs distribution given the TME components of tumor vessels and cell nuclei## and the experimental results show that DAMM-Diffusion can generate the distribution of NPs with higher accuracy than the comparing methods. Additional results on the multi-modal brain image synthesis task further validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.,0,0

32483,,2411.19946,DELT: A Simple Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training for Dataset Distillation,Recent advances in dataset distillation have led to solutions in two main directions. The conventional batch-to-batch matching mechanism is ideal for small-scale datasets and includes bi-level optimization methods on models and syntheses## such as FRePo## RCIG## and RaT-BPTT## as well as other methods like distribution matching## gradient matching## and weight trajectory matching. Conversely## batch-to-global matching typifies decoupled methods## which are particularly advantageous for large-scale datasets. This approach has garnered substantial interest within the community## as seen in SRe^2L## G-VBSM## WMDD## and CDA. A primary challenge with the second approach is the lack of diversity among syntheses within each class since samples are optimized independently and the same global supervision signals are reused across different synthetic images. In this study## we propose a new Diversity-driven EarlyLate Training (DELT) scheme to enhance the diversity of images in batch-to-global matching with less computation. Our approach is conceptually simple yet effective## it partitions predefined IPC samples into smaller subtasks and employs local optimizations to distill each subset into distributions from distinct phases## reducing the uniformity induced by the unified optimization process.

To address these issues## we propose a Differentiable Feature Matching  (DFM) framework for joint optimization of the feature extractor and the matching head. DFM transforms nearest-neighbor matching into a pooling-based module and embeds it within a Feature Matching Network (FMN).

32951,,,DH-Set: Improving Vision-Language Alignment with Diverse and Hybrid Set-Embeddings Learning,Vision-Language (VL) alignment across image and text modalities is a challenging task due to the inherent semantic ambiguity of data with multiple possible meanings. Existing methods typically solve it by learning multiple sub-representation spaces to encode each input data as a set of embeddings## and constraining diversity between whole subspaces to capture diverse semantics for accurate VL alignment.

Ignoring this intrinsic property## existing diversity constraints imposed on the whole subspace may impair diverse embedding learning; 2) multiple embeddings are inevitably introduced## sacrificing computational and storage efficiency. In this paper## we propose a simple yet effective Diverse and Hybrid Set-embeddings learning framework (DH-Set)## which is distinct from prior work in three aspects. DH-Set 1) devises a novel semantic importance dissecting method to focus on key local dimensions within each subspace; and thereby 2) not only imposes finer-grained diversity constraint to improve the accuracy of diverse embedding learning## 3) but also mixes key dimensions of all subspaces into the single hybrid embedding to boost inference efficiency.

Therefore## in this paper## we focus on a challenging practical task called Cloth-Hybrid Lifelong Person Re-identification (CH-LReID)## which requires matching the same person wearing different clothes using sequentially collected data. A Differentiated Knowledge Consolidation (DKC) framework is designed to unify and balance distinct knowledge across streaming data. The core idea is to adaptively balance differentiated knowledge and compatibly consolidate cloth-relevant and cloth-irrelevant information. To this end## a Differentiated Knowledge Transfer (DKT) module and a Latent Knowledge Consolidation (LKC) module are designed to adaptively discover differentiated new knowledge## while eliminating the derived domain shift of old knowledge via reconstructing the old latent feature space## respectively. Then## to further alleviate the catastrophic conflict between differentiated new and old knowledge## we further propose a Dual-level Distribution Alignment (DDA) module to align the distribution of discriminative knowledge at both the instance level and the fine-grained level.

33140,,2505.11676,DPSeg: Dual-Prompt Cost Volume Learning for Open-Vocabulary Semantic Segmentation,Open-vocabulary semantic segmentation aims to segment images into distinct semantic regions for both seen and unseen categories at the pixel level. Current methods utilize text embeddings from pre-trained vision-language models like CLIP but struggle with the inherent domain gap between image and text embeddings## even after extensive alignment during training.

33698,,2411.08227,DPU: Dynamic Prototype Updating for Multimodal Out-of-Distribution Detection,Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection is crucial for ensuring the robustness of machine learning models by identifying samples that deviate from the training distribution. While traditional OOD detection has predominantly focused on single-modality inputs## such as images## recent advancements in multimodal models have shown the potential of utilizing multiple modalities (e.g.## video## optical flow## audio) to improve detection performance. However## existing approaches often neglect intra-class variability within in-distribution (ID) data## assuming that samples of the same class are perfectly cohesive and consistent.

34428,,,DTGBrepGen: A Novel B-rep Generative Model through Decoupling Topology and Geometry,Boundary representation (B-rep) of geometric models is a fundamental format in Computer-Aided Design (CAD). However##  automatically generating valid and high-quality B-rep models remains challenging due to the complex interdependence between the topology and geometry of the models.

34371,,,D^2iT: Dynamic Diffusion Transformer for Accurate Image Generation,Diffusion models are widely recognized for their ability to generate high-fidelity images. Despite the excellent performance and scalability of the Diffusion Transformer (DiT) architecture## it applies fixed compression across different image regions during the diffusion process## disregarding the naturally varying information densities present in these regions. However## large compression leads to limited local realism## while small compression increases computational complexity and compromises global consistency## ultimately impacting the quality of generated images. To address these limitations## we propose dynamically compressing different image regions by recognizing the importance of different regions## and introduce a novel two-stage framework designed to enhance the effectiveness and efficiency of image generation: (1) Dynamic VAE (DVAE) at first stage employs a hierarchical encoder to encode different image regions at different downsampling rates## tailored to their specific information densities## thereby providing more accurate and natural latent codes for the diffusion process. (2) Dynamic Diffusion Transformer (D^2iT) at second stage generates images by predicting multi-grained noise## consisting of coarse-grained (less latent code in smooth regions) and fine-grained (more latent codes in detailed regions)## through an novel combination of the Dynamic Grain Transformer and the Dynamic Content Transformer. The strategy of combining rough prediction of noise with detailed regions correction achieves a unification of global consistency and local realism.

Past monocular video human reconstruction primarily focuses on reconstructing undecoupled clothed human bodies or only reconstructing clothing## making it difficult to apply directly in applications such as animation production. The challenge in reconstructing decoupled clothing and body lies in the occlusion caused by clothing over the body. To this end## the details of the visible area and the plausibility of the invisible area must be ensured during the reconstruction process. Our proposed method combines explicit and implicit representations to model the decoupled clothed human body## leveraging the robustness of explicit representations and the flexibility of implicit representations.

34870,,,D^3: Scaling Up Deepfake Detection by Learning from Discrepancy,The boom of Generative AI brings opportunities entangled with risks and concerns. Existing literature emphasizes the generalization capability of deepfake detection on unseen generators## significantly promoting the detector's ability to identify more universal artifacts. This work seeks a step toward a universal deepfake detection system with better generalization and robustness. We do so by first scaling up the existing detection task setup from the one-generator to multiple-generators in training## during which we disclose two challenges presented in prior methodological designs and demonstrate the divergence of detectors' performance. Specifically## we reveal that the current methods tailored for training on one specific generator either struggle to learn comprehensive artifacts from multiple generators or sacrifice their fitting ability for seen generators (i.e.## In-Domain (ID) performance) to exchange the generalization for unseen generators (i.e.## Out-Of-Domain (OOD) performance). To tackle the above challenges## we propose our Discrepancy Deepfake Detector (D3) framework## whose core idea is to deconstruct the universal artifacts from multiple generators by introducing a parallel network branch that takes a distorted image feature as an extra discrepancy signal and supplements its original counterpart. Extensive scaled-up experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of D3## achieving 5.3% accuracy improvement in the OOD testing compared to the current SOTA methods while maintaining the ID performance.

33594,,,D^3CTTA: Domain-Dependent Decorrelation for Continual Test-Time Adaption of 3D LiDAR Segmentation,Adapting pre-trained LiDAR segmentation models to dynamic domain shifts during testing is of paramount importance for the safety of autonomous driving.  Most existing methods neglect the influence of domain changes and point density in continual test-time adaption (CTTA)## relying on backpropagation and large batch sizes for stability. We approach this problem with three insights: 1) Point clouds at different distances usually have different densities resulting in distribution disparities; 2) The feature distribution of different domains varies## and domain-aware parameters can alleviate domain gaps; 3) Features are highly correlated and make segmentation of different labels confusing.  To this end## this work presents D^3CTTA## an online backpropagation-free framework for 3D continual test-time adaption for LiDAR segmentation. D^3CTTA consists of a distance-aware prototype learning module to integrate LiDAR-based geometry prior and a domain-dependent decorrelation module to reduce feature correlations among different domains and different categories.

However## SDS-based editing methods suffer from lengthy optimization processes with slow inference and low quality. We attribute the issue of lengthy optimization to the stochastic optimization scheme used in SDS-based editing## where many steps may conflict with each other (e.g.## the inherent trade-off between editing and preservation). To reduce this internal conflict and speed up the editing process## we propose to separate editing and preservation in time with a diffusion time schedule and frame the 3D editing optimization process as a diffusion bridge sampling process.

32893,,2502.20499,Data Distributional Properties As Inductive Bias for Systematic Generalization,Deep neural networks (DNNs) struggle at systematic generalization (SG). Several studies have evaluated the possibility of promoting SG through the proposal of novel architectures## loss functions## or training methodologies. Few studies## however## have focused on the role of training data properties in promoting SG. In this work## we investigate the impact of certain data distributional properties## as inductive biases for the SG ability of a multi-modal language model. To this end## we study three different properties. First## data diversity## instantiated as an increase in the possible values a latent property in the training distribution may take. Second## burstiness## where we probabilistically restrict the number of possible values of latent factors on particular inputs during training. Third## latent intervention## where a particular latent factor is altered randomly during training. We find that all three factors significantly enhance SG## with diversity contributing an 89% absolute increase in accuracy in the most affected property. Through a series of experiments## we test various hypotheses to understand why these properties promote SG. Finally## we find that Normalized Mutual Information (NMI) between latent attributes in the training distribution is strongly predictive of out-of-distribution generalization. We find that a mechanism by which lower NMI induces SG is in the geometry of representations. In particular## we find that NMI induces more parallelism in neural representations (i.e.## input features coded in parallel neural vectors) of the model## a property related to the capacity of reasoning by analogy.,0,0

Quantization of diffusion models has been explored in recent works to reduce compute costs and memory bandwidth usage. To further improve inference time## fast convolution algorithms such as Winograd can be used for convolution layers## which account for a significant portion of computations in diffusion models. However## the significant quality loss of fully quantized Winograd using existing coarser-grained post-training quantization methods## combined with the complexity and cost of finetuning the Winograd transformation matrices for such large models to recover quality## makes them unsuitable for large-scale foundation models. Motivated by the presence of a large range of values in them## we investigate the impact of finer-grained group-wise quantization in quantizing diffusion models. While group-wise quantization can largely handle the fully quantized Winograd convolution## it struggles to deal with the large distribution imbalance in a sizable portion of the Winograd domain computation. To reduce range differences in the Winograd domain## we propose finetuning only the scale parameters of the Winograd transform matrices without using any domain-specific training data. Because our method does not depend on any training data## the generalization performance of quantized diffusion models is safely guaranteed. For text-to-image generation task## the 8-bit fully-quantized diffusion model with Winograd provides near-lossless quality (FID and CLIP scores) in comparison to the full-precision model. This## coupled with the development of highly optimized kernels for group-wise fully quantized Winograd## improves CPU wall-clock time by 31.3% when compared to the convolution layers of a diffusion model.

In this paper## we reformulate dataset distillation as a minmax optimization problem and introduce Neural Characteristic Function Discrepancy (NCFD)## a comprehensive and theoretically grounded metric for measuring distributional differences. NCFD leverages the Characteristic Function (CF) to encapsulate full distributional information## employing a neural network to optimize the sampling strategy for the CF's frequency arguments## thereby maximizing the discrepancy to enhance distance estimation. Simultaneously## we minimize the difference between real and synthetic data under this optimized NCFD measure.

35109,,2411.16154,DeDe: Detecting Backdoor Samples for SSL Encoders via Decoders,Self-supervised learning (SSL) is pervasively exploited in training high-quality upstream encoders with a large amount of unlabeled data. However## it is found to be susceptible to backdoor attacks merely via polluting a small portion of training data. The victim encoders associate triggered inputs with target embeddings## e.g.## mapping a triggered cat image to an airplane embedding## such that the downstream tasks inherit unintended behaviors when the trigger is activated. Emerging backdoor attacks have shown great threats across different SSL paradigms such as contrastive learning and CLIP## yet limited research is devoted to defending against such attacks## and existing defenses fall short in detecting advanced stealthy backdoors. To address the limitations## we propose a novel detection mechanism## DeDe## which detects the activation of backdoor mappings caused by triggered inputs on victim encoders. Specifically## DeDe trains a decoder for any given SSL encoder using an auxiliary dataset (which can be out-of-distribution or even slightly poisoned)## so that for any triggered input that misleads the encoder into the target embedding## the decoder generates an output image significantly different from the input. DeDe leverages the discrepancy between the input and the decoded output to identify potential backdoor misbehavior during inference. We empirically evaluate DeDe on both contrastive learning and CLIP models against various types of backdoor attacks. Our results demonstrate promising detection effectiveness over various advanced attacks and superior performance compared over state-of-the-art detection methods.,0,0

However## these large models typically process videos by averaging embedding outputs from multiple clips over time to produce fixed-length representations. This approach fails to account for a variety of time-related features## such as variable video durations## chronological order of events## and temporal variance in feature significance. While methods for temporal modeling do exist## they often require significant architectural changes and expensive retraining## making them impractical for off-the-shelf## fine-tuned large encoders. To overcome these limitations## we propose DejaVid## an encoder-agnostic method that enhances model performance without the need for retraining or altering the architecture. Our framework converts a video into a variable-length temporal sequence of embeddings (TSE). A TSE naturally preserves temporal order and accommodates variable video durations. We then learn per-timestep## per-feature weights over the encoded TSE frames## allowing us to account for variations in feature importance over time. We introduce a new neural network architecture inspired by traditional time series alignment algorithms for this learning task. Our evaluation demonstrates that DejaVid substantially improves the performance of a state-of-the-art large encoder## achieving leading Top-1 accuracy of 77.2% on Something-Something V2## 89.1% on Kinetics-400## and 88.6% on HMDB51## while adding fewer than 1.8% additional learnable parameters and requiring less than 3 hours of training time.

33234,,,Denoising Functional Maps: Diffusion Models for Shape Correspondence,Estimating correspondences between pairs of deformable shapes remains a challenging problem. Despite substantial progress## existing methods lack broad generalization capabilities and require category-specific training data. To address these limitations## we propose a fundamentally new approach to shape correspondence based on denoising diffusion models. In our method## a diffusion model learns to directly predict the functional map## a low-dimensional representation of a point-wise map between shapes. We use a large dataset of synthetic human meshes for training and employ two steps to reduce the number of functional maps that need to be learned. First## the maps refer to a template rather than shape pairs. Second## the functional map is defined in a basis of eigenvectors of the Laplacian## which is not unique due to sign ambiguity. Therefore## we introduce an unsupervised approach to select a specific basis by correcting the signs of eigenvectors based on surface features. Our model achieves competitive performance on standard human datasets## meshes with anisotropic connectivity## non-isometric humanoid shapes## as well as animals compared to existing descriptor-based and large-scale shape deformation methods.,0,0

32781,,,Dense-SfM: Structure from Motion with Dense Consistent Matching,We present Dense-SfM## a novel Structure from Motion (SfM) framework designed for dense and accurate 3D reconstruction from multi-view images. Sparse keypoint matching## which traditional SfM methods often rely on## limits both accuracy and point density## especially in texture-less areas. Dense-SfM addresses this limitation by integrating dense matching with a Gaussian Splatting (GS) based track extension which gives more consistent## longer feature tracks. To further improve reconstruction accuracy## Dense-SfM is equipped with a multi-view kernelized matching module leveraging transformer and Gaussian Process architectures## for robust track refinement across multi-views.

32925,,2501.02464,Depth Any Camera: Zero-Shot Metric Depth Estimation from Any Camera,While recent depth foundation models exhibit strong zero-shot generalization## achieving accurate metric depth across diverse camera types--particularly those with large fields of view (FoV) such as fisheye and 360-degree cameras--remains a significant challenge. This paper presents Depth Any Camera (DAC)## a powerful zero-shot metric depth estimation framework that extends a perspective-trained model to effectively handle cameras with varying FoVs. The framework is designed to ensure that all existing 3D data can be leveraged## regardless of the specific camera types used in new applications.

However## rendering high-resolution images remains computationally intensive due to the need for dense sampling of all rays. Recognizing that natural scenes are typically piecewise smooth and sampling all rays is often redundant## we propose a novel depth-guided bundle sampling strategy to accelerate rendering. By grouping adjacent rays into a bundle and sampling them collectively## a shared representation is generated for decoding all rays within the bundle. To further optimize efficiency## our adaptive sampling strategy dynamically allocates samples based on depth confidence## concentrating more samples in complex regions while reducing them in smoother areas. When applied to ENeRF## our method achieves up to a 1.27 dB PSNR improvement and a 47% increase in FPS on the DTU dataset.

We present DepthCrafter## an innovative method for generating temporally consistent long depth sequences with intricate details for open-world videos## without requiring any supplementary information such as camera poses or optical flow. The generalization ability to open-world videos is achieved by training the video-to-depth model from a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model## through our meticulously designed three-stage training strategy.

34680,,,DepthCues: Evaluating Monocular Depth Perception in Large Vision Models,Large-scale pre-trained vision models are becoming increasingly prevalent## offering expressive and generalizable visual representations that benefit various downstream tasks. Recent studies on the emergent properties of these models have revealed their high-level geometric understanding## in particular in the context of depth perception. However## it remains unclear how depth perception arises in these models without explicit depth supervision provided during pre-training. To investigate this## we examine whether the monocular depth cues## similar to those used by the human visual system## emerge in these models. We introduce a new benchmark## DepthCues## designed to evaluate depth cue understanding## and present findings across 20 diverse and representative pre-trained vision models.

32696,,2410.13862,DepthSplat: Connecting Gaussian Splatting and Depth,Gaussian splatting and single-view depth estimation are typically studied in isolation. In this paper## we present DepthSplat to connect Gaussian splatting and depth estimation and study their interactions. More specifically## we first contribute a robust multi-view depth model by leveraging pre-trained monocular depth features## leading to high-quality feed-forward 3D Gaussian splatting reconstructions. We also show that Gaussian splatting can serve as an unsupervised pre-training objective for learning powerful depth models from large-scale multi-view posed datasets. We validate the synergy between Gaussian splatting and depth estimation through extensive ablation and cross-task transfer experiments. Our DepthSplat achieves state-of-the-art performance on ScanNet## RealEstate10K and DL3DV datasets in terms of both depth estimation and novel view synthesis## demonstrating the mutual benefits of connecting both tasks.

32385,,2411.15265,Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Constrained Gradient for Unified XAI,Gradient-based methods are a prototypical family of 'explainability for AI' (XAI) techniques## especially for image-based models. However## they (1) require white-box access to models## (2) are vulnerable to adversarial attacks## and (3) produce attributions that lie off the image manifold## leading to explanations that are not amenable to human perception. To overcome these challenges## we introduce Derivative-Free Diffusion Manifold-Contrained Gradients (FreeMCG): by leveraging ensemble Kalman filters and diffusion models## we derive a derivative-free approximation of the model's gradient projected onto the data manifold## requiring access only to the model's outputs (i.e.## black-box setting). We demonstrate the effectiveness of FreeMCG by applying it to both counterfactual generation and feature attribution## which have traditionally been treated as different tasks requiring distinct methods. Through comprehensive evaluation on both counterfactual explanation and feature attribution we show that our method yields state-of-the-art results for both tasks while preserving the essential properties expected of XAI tools.

32867,,,Descriptor-In-Pixel : Point-Feature Tracking For Pixel Processor Arrays,This paper presents a novel approach for joint point-feature detection and tracking## designed specifically for Pixel Processor Array (PPA) vision sensors. Instead of standard pixels## PPA sensors consist of thousands of 'pixel-processors'## enabling massive parallel computation of visual data at the point of light capture. Our approach performs all computation entirely in-pixel## meaning no raw image data need ever leave the sensor for external processing. We introduce a Descriptor-In-Pixel paradigm## in which a feature descriptor is held within the memory of each pixel-processor. The PPA's architecture enables the response of every processor's descriptor## upon the current image## to be computed in parallel. This produces a 'descriptor response map'## which## by generating the correct layout of descriptors across the pixel-processors## can be used for both point-feature detection and tracking. This reduces sensor output to just sparse feature locations and descriptors## read-out via an address-event interface## giving a greater than 1000X reduction in data transfer compared to raw image output. The sparse readout and complete utilization of all pixel-processors makes our approach very efficient. Our implementation upon the SCAMP-7 PPA prototype runs at over 3000 FPS (Frames Per Second)## tracking point-features reliably under violent motion. This is the first work performing point-feature detection and tracking entirely in-pixel.,0,0
33416,,2412.08603,Design2GarmentCode: Turning Design Concepts to Tangible Garments Through Program Synthesis,Sewing patterns## the essential blueprints for fabric cutting and tailoring## act as a crucial bridge between design concepts and producible garments. However## existing uni-modal sewing pattern generation models struggle to effectively encode complex design concepts with a multi-modal nature and correlate them with vectorized sewing patterns that possess precise geometric structures and intricate sewing relations.

35024,,2503.01645,DesignDiffusion: High-Quality Text-to-Design Image Generation with Diffusion Models,In this paper## we present DesignDiffusion## a simple yet effective framework for the novel task of synthesizing design images from textual descriptions. A primary challenge lies in generating accurate and style-consistent textual and visual content. Existing works in a related task of visual text generation often focus on generating text within given specific regions## which limits the creativity of generation models## resulting in style or color inconsistencies between textual and visual elements if applied to design image generation. To address this issue## we propose an end-to-end## one-stage diffusion-based framework that avoids intricate components like position and layout modeling. Specifically## the proposed framework directly synthesizes textual and visual design elements from user prompts. It utilizes a distinctive character embedding derived from the visual text to enhance the input prompt## along with a character localization loss for enhanced supervision during text generation.

34625,,2412.17630,Detail-Preserving Latent Diffusion for Stable Shadow Removal,Achieving high-quality shadow removal with strong generalizability is challenging in scenes with complex global illumination. Due to the limited diversity in shadow removal datasets## current methods are prone to overfitting training data## often leading to reduced performance on unseen cases. To address this## we leverage the rich visual priors of a pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) model and propose a two-stage fine-tuning pipeline to adapt the SD model for stable and efficient shadow removal. In the first stage## we fix the VAE and fine-tune the denoiser in latent space## which yields substantial shadow removal but may lose some high-frequency details. To resolve this## we introduce a second stage## called the detail injection stage. This stage selectively extracts features from the VAE encoder to modulate the decoder## injecting fine details into the final results. Experimental results show that our method outperforms state-of-the-art shadow removal techniques. The cross-dataset evaluation further demonstrates that our method generalizes effectively to unseen data## enhancing the applicability of shadow removal methods.,0,0
33515,,,Detect Any Mirrors: Boosting Learning Reliability on Large-Scale Unlabeled Data with an Iterative Data Engine,Mirror detection is a challenging task because a mirror's visual appearance varies depending on the reflected content. Due to limited annotated data## current methods failed to generalize well for detecting diverse mirror scenes. Semi-supervised learning with large-scale unlabeled data can improve generalization capabilities on mirror detection## but these methods often suffer from unreliable pseudo-labels due to distribution differences between labeled and unlabeled data## therefore affecting the learning process. To address this issue## we first collect a large-scale dataset of approximately 0.4 million mirror-related images from the internet## significantly expanding the data scale for mirror detection. To effectively exploit this unlabeled dataset## we propose the first semi-supervised framework (namely an iterative data engine) consisting of four steps: (1) mirror detection model training## (2) pseudo label prediction## (3) dual guidance scoring## and (4) selection of highly reliable pseudo labels. In each iteration of the data engine## we employ a geometric accuracy scoring approach to assess pseudo labels based on multiple segmentation metrics## and design a multi-modal agent-driven semantic scoring approach to enhance the semantic perception of pseudo labels. These two scoring approaches can effectively improve the reliability of pseudo labels by selecting unlabeled samples with higher scores. Our method demonstrates promising performance across three mirror detection tasks and exhibits strong generalization on unseen examples.

32690,,,Detect-and-Guide: Self-regulation of Diffusion Models for Safe Text-to-Image Generation via Guideline Token Optimization,Text-to-image diffusion models have achieved state-of-the-art results in synthesis tasks; however## there is a growing concern about their potential misuse in creating harmful content. To mitigate these risks## post-hoc model intervention techniques## such as concept unlearning and safety guidance## have been developed. However## fine-tuning model weights or adapting the hidden states of the diffusion model operates in an uninterpretable way## making it unclear which part of the intermediate variables is responsible for unsafe generation. These interventions severely affect the sampling trajectory when erasing harmful concepts from complex## multi-concept prompts## thus hindering their practical use in real-world settings. In this work## we propose the safe generation framework Detect-and-Guide (DAG)## leveraging the internal knowledge of diffusion models to perform self-diagnosis and fine-grained self-regulation during the sampling process. DAG first detects harmful concepts from noisy latents using refined cross-attention maps of optimized tokens## then applies safety guidance with adaptive strength and editing regions to negate unsafe generation. The optimization only requires a small annotated dataset and can provide precise detection maps with generalizability and concept specificity. Moreover## DAG does not require fine-tuning of diffusion models## and therefore introduces no loss to their generation diversity. Experiments on erasing sexual content show that DAG achieves state-of-the-art safe generation performance## balancing harmfulness mitigation and text-following performance on multi-concept real-world prompts.,0,0

Although previous detection methods achieve high performance in detecting gradient-based adversarial attacks## new attacks based on generative models with imbalanced and anisotropic noise patterns evade detection. Even worse## the significant inference time overhead and limited performance against unseen attacks make existing techniques impractical for real-world use. In this paper## we explore the proximity relationship among adversarial noise distributions and demonstrate the existence of an open covering for these distributions. By training on the open covering of adversarial noise distributions## a detector with strong generalization performance against various types of unseen attacks can be developed.

32667,,2503.07978,Detecting Backdoor Attacks in Federated Learning via Direction Alignment Inspection,The distributed nature of training makes Federated Learning (FL) vulnerable to backdoor attacks## where malicious model updates aim to compromise the global model's performance on specific tasks. Existing defense methods show limited efficacy as they overlook the inconsistency between benign and malicious model updates regarding both general and fine-grained directions. To fill this gap## we introduce AlignIns## a novel defense method designed to safeguard FL systems against backdoor attacks. AlignIns looks into the direction of each model update through a direction alignment inspection process. Specifically## it examines the alignment of model updates with the overall update direction and analyzes the distribution of the signs of their significant parameters## comparing them with the principle sign across all model updates. Model updates that exhibit an unusual degree of alignment are considered malicious and thus be filtered out. We provide the theoretical analysis of the robustness of AlignIns and its propagation error in FL. Our empirical results on both independent and identically distributed (IID) and non-IID datasets demonstrate that AlignIns achieves higher robustness compared to the state-of-the-art defense methods.

Apart from recognizing known objects from training## a successful Open World Object Detection (OWOD) system must also be able to detect unknown objects never seen before## without confusing them with the backgrounds. Unlike prevailing prior works that rely on probability models to learn 'objectness'## we focus on learning fine-grained## class-agnostic attributes## allowing the detection of both known and unknown objects in an explainable manner. In this paper## we propose Partial Attribute Assignment (PASS)## aiming to automatically select and optimize a small## relevant subset of attributes from a large attribute pool. Specifically## we model attribute selection as a Partial Optimal Transport (POT) problem between known visual objects and the attribute pool## in which more relevant attributes signify more transported mass. PASS follows a curriculum schedule that progressively selects and optimizes a targeted subset of attributes during training## promoting stability and accuracy. Our method enjoys end-to-end optimization by minimizing the POT distance and the classification loss on known visual objects## demonstrating high training efficiency and superior OWOD performance among extensive experimental evaluations.,0,0
32587,,2311.01479,Detecting Out-of-Distribution Through the Lens of Neural Collapse,Out-of-Distribution (OOD) detection is critical for safe deployment; however## existing detectors often struggle to generalize across datasets of varying scales and model architectures## and some can incur high computational costs in real-world applications. Inspired by the phenomenon of Neural Collapse## we propose a versatile and efficient OOD detection method. Specifically## we re-characterize prior observations that in-distribution (ID) samples form clusters## demonstrating that## with appropriate centering## these clusters align closely with model weight vectors. Additionally## we reveal that ID features tend to expand into a simplex Equiangular Tight Frame## explaining the common observation that ID features are situated farther from the origin than OOD features. Incorporating both insights from Neural Collapse## our OOD detector leverages feature proximity to weight vectors and complements this approach by using feature norms to effectively filter out OOD samples. Extensive experiments on off-the-shelf models demonstrate the robustness of our OOD detector across diverse scenarios## mitigating generalization discrepancies and enhancing overall performance## with inference latency comparable to that of the basic softmax-confidence detector.

32647,,,Detection-Friendly Nonuniformity Correction: A Union Framework for Infrared UAV Target Detection,Infrared unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) images captured using thermal detectors are often affected by temperature-dependent low-frequency nonuniformity## which significantly reduces the contrast of the images. Detecting UAV targets under nonuniform conditions is crucial in UAV surveillance applications. Existing methods typically treat infrared nonuniformity correction (NUC) as a preprocessing step for detection## which leads to suboptimal performance. Balancing the two tasks while enhancing detection-beneficial information remains challenging. In this paper## we present a detection-friendly union framework## termed UniCD## that simultaneously addresses both infrared NUC and UAV target detection tasks in an end-to-end manner. We first model NUC as a small number of parameter estimation problem jointly driven by priors and data to generate detection-conducive images. Then## we incorporate a new auxiliary loss with target mask supervision into the backbone of the infrared UAV target detection network to strengthen target features while suppressing the background. To better balance correction and detection## we introduce a detection-guided self-supervised loss to reduce feature discrepancies between the two tasks## thereby enhancing detection robustness to varying nonuniformity levels. Additionally## we construct a new benchmark composed of 50##000 infrared images in various nonuniformity types## multi-scale UAV targets and rich backgrounds with target annotations## called IRBFD.

However## recent works show GNNs are vulnerable to  training-time poisoning attacks -- marginally perturbing edges## nodes## and node features of training graphs can largely degrade the GNN performance. Most previous defenses against such attacks are empirical and are soon broken by adaptive / stronger ones. A few provable defenses provide robustness guarantees## but have large gaps when applied in practice: 1) all restrict the attacker's capability to only one type of perturbation; 2) all are designed for a particular GNN task; and 3) their  robustness guarantees are not 100% accurate. In this work## we bridge all these gaps by developing PGNNCert## the first certified defense of GNNs against poisoning attacks under arbitrary (edge## node## and node feature) perturbations with deterministic (100% accurate) robustness guarantees. PGNNCert is also applicable to the two most widely-studied node and graph classification tasks.

32829,,,Devil is in the Detail: Towards Injecting Fine Details of Image Prompt in Image Generation via Conflict-free Guidance and Stratified Attention,While large-scale text-to-image diffusion models enable the generation of high-quality## diverse images from text prompts## these prompts struggle to capture intricate details## such as textures## preventing the user intent from being reflected. This limitation has led to efforts to generate images conditioned on user-provided images## referred to as image prompts. Recent work modifies the self-attention mechanism to impose image conditions in generated images by replacing or concatenating the keys and values from the image prompt. This enables the self-attention layer to work like a cross-attention layer## generally used to incorporate text prompts.In this paper## we identify two common issues in existing methods of modifying self-attention that hinder diffusion models from reflecting the image prompt. By addressing these issues## we propose a novel method that generates images that properly reflect the details of image prompts. First## existing approaches often neglect the importance of image prompts in classifier-free guidance## which directs the model towards the intended conditions and away from those undesirable. Specifically## current methods use image prompts as both desired and undesired conditions## causing conflicting signals. To resolve this## we propose conflict-free guidance by using image prompts only as desired conditions## ensuring that the generated image faithfully reflects the image prompt.In addition## we observe that the two most common self-attention modifications involve a trade-off between the realism of the generated image and alignment with the image prompt## achieved by selectively using keys and values from both images. Specifically## selecting more keys and values from the image prompt improves alignment## while selecting more from the generated image enhances realism. To balance both## we propose an alternative self-attention modification method## Stratified Attention## which jointly uses keys and values from both images rather than selecting between them.Through extensive experiments across three distinct image generation tasks## we demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms existing image-prompting models in faithfully reflecting the image prompt.,0,0
35035,,2411.16724,Devils in Middle Layers of Large Vision-Language Models: Interpreting## Detecting and Mitigating Object Hallucinations via Attention Lens,Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) significantly undermine their reliability## motivating researchers to explore the causes of hallucination. However## most studies primarily focus on the language aspect rather than the visual. In this paper## we address how LVLMs process visual information and whether this process causes hallucination. Firstly## we use the attention lens to identify the stages at which LVLMs handle visual data## discovering that the middle layers are crucial. Moreover## we find that these layers can be further divided into two stages: 'visual information enrichment' and 'semantic refinement' which respectively propagate visual data to object tokens and interpret it through text. By analyzing attention patterns during the visual information enrichment stage## we find that real tokens consistently receive higher attention weights than hallucinated ones## serving as a strong indicator of hallucination. Further examination of multi-head attention maps reveals that hallucination tokens often result from heads interacting with inconsistent objects. Based on these insights## we propose a simple inference-time method that adjusts visual attention by integrating information across various heads. Extensive experiments demonstrate that this approach effectively mitigates hallucinations in mainstream LVLMs without additional training costs.,0,0

To overcome these limitations## we propose DiffLocks## a novel framework that enables detailed reconstruction of a wide variety of hairstyles directly from a single image. First## we address the lack of 3D hair data by automating the creation of the largest synthetic hair dataset to date## containing 40K hairstyles. Second## we leverage the synthetic hair dataset to learn an image-conditioned diffusion-transfomer model that generates accurate 3D strands from a single frontal image. By using a pretrained image backbone## our method generalizes to in-the-wild images despite being trained only on synthetic data. Our diffusion model predicts a scalp texture map in which any point in the map contains the latent code for an individual hair strand. These codes are directly decoded to 3D strands without post-processing techniques. Representing individual strands## instead of guide strands## enables the transformer to model the detailed spatial structure of complex hairstyles.

33029,,,Difference Inversion: Interpolate and Isolate the Difference with Token Consistency for Image Analogy Generation,How can we generate an image B' that satisfies A:A'::B:B'## given the input images A##A' and B? Recent works have tackled this challenge through approaches like visual in-context learning or visual instruction. However## these methods are typically limited to specific models (InstructPix2Pix.

33085,,2411.17994,Differentiable Inverse Rendering with Interpretable Basis BRDFs,Inverse rendering seeks to reconstruct both geometry and spatially varying BRDFs (SVBRDFs) from captured images. To address the inherent ill-posedness of inverse rendering## basis BRDF representations are commonly used## modeling SVBRDFs as spatially varying blends of a set of basis BRDFs. However## existing methods often yield basis BRDFs that lack intuitive separation and have limited scalability to scenes of varying complexity. In this paper## we introduce a differentiable inverse rendering method that produces interpretable basis BRDFs. Our approach models a scene using 2D Gaussians## where the reflectance of each Gaussian is defined by a weighted blend of basis BRDFs. We efficiently render an image from the 2D Gaussians and basis BRDFs using differentiable rasterization and impose a specular-weighted rendering loss with the input flash photography images. During this analysis-by-synthesis optimization process of differentiable inverse rendering## we dynamically adjust the number of basis BRDFs to fit the target scene while encouraging sparsity in the basis weights. This ensures that the reflectance of each Gaussian is represented by only a few basis BRDFs.

35090,,,Diffusion Bridge: Leveraging Diffusion Model to Reduce the Modality Gap Between Text and Vision for Zero-Shot Image Captioning,The modality gap between vision and text embeddings in CLIP presents a significant challenge for zero-shot image captioning## limiting effective cross-modal representation. Traditional approaches## such as noise injection and memory-based similarity matching## attempt to address this gap## yet these methods either rely on indirect alignment or relatively naive solutions with heavy computation. Diffusion Bridge introduces a novel approach to directly reduce this modality gap by leveraging Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPM)## trained exclusively on text embeddings to model their distribution. Our approach is motivated by the observation that## while paired vision and text embeddings are relatively close## a modality gap still exists due to stable regions created by the contrastive loss. This gap can be interpreted as noise in cross-modal mappings## which we approximate as Gaussian noise. To bridge this gap## we employ a reverse diffusion process## where image embeddings are strategically introduced at an intermediate step in the reverse process## allowing them to be refined progressively toward the text embedding distribution. This process transforms vision embeddings into text-like representations closely aligned with paired text embeddings## effectively minimizing discrepancies between modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that these text-like vision embeddings significantly enhance alignment with their paired text embeddings## leading to improved zero-shot captioning performance on MSCOCO and Flickr30K. Diffusion Bridge achieves competitive results without reliance on memory banks or entity-driven methods## offering a novel pathway for cross-modal alignment and opening new possibilities for the application of diffusion models in multi-modal tasks.

33386,,,Diffusion-based Event Generation for High-Quality Image Deblurring,While event-based deblurring have demonstrated impressive results## they are impractical for consumer photos captured by cell phones and digital cameras that are not equipped with the event sensor. To address this problem## we in this paper propose a novel deblurring framework called Event Generation Deblurring (EGDeblurring)## which allows to effectively deblur an image by generating event guidance describing the motion information using a diffusion model. Specifically## we design a motion prior generation diffusion model and a feature extractor to produce prior information beneficial for deblurring## rather than generating the raw event representation. In order to achieve effective fusion of motion prior information with blurry images and produce high-quality results## we develop a regression deblurring network embedded with a dual-attention channel fusion block.

A digital twin of a 3D object is a highly detailed## virtually indistinguishable representation of a physical object## accurately capturing its shape## appearance## physical properties## and other attributes. Recent advances in neural-based 3D reconstruction and inverse rendering have significantly improved the quality of 3D object reconstruction.

35235,,2503.06900,DirectTriGS: Triplane-based Gaussian Splatting Field Representation for 3D Generation,We present DirectTriGS## a novel framework designed for 3D object generation with Gaussian Splatting (GS). GS-based rendering for 3D content has gained considerable attention recently. However## there has been limited exploration in directly generating 3D Gaussians compared to traditional generative modeling approaches. The main challenge lies in the complex data structure of GS represented by discrete point clouds with multiple channels.To overcome this challenge## we propose employing the triplane representation## which allows us to represent Gaussian Splatting as an image-like continuous field. This representation effectively encodes both the geometry and texture information## enabling smooth transformation back to Gaussian point clouds and rendering into images by a TriRenderer## with only 2D supervisions. The proposed TriRenderer is fully differentiable## so that the rendering loss can supervise both texture and geometry encoding. Furthermore## the triplane representation can be compressed using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE)## which can subsequently be utilized in latent diffusion to generate 3D objects.The experiments demonstrate that the proposed generation framework can produce high-quality 3D object geometry and rendering results.,0,0
33218,,,Directional Label Diffusion Model for Learning from Noisy Labels,In image classification## the label quality of training data critically influences model generalization## especially for deep neural networks (DNNs). Traditionally## learning from noisy labels (LNL) can improve the generalization of DNNs through complex architectures or a series of robust techniques## but its performance improvement is limited by the discriminative paradigm. Unlike traditional ways## we resolve the LNL problems from the perspective of robust label generation## based on diffusion models within the generative paradigm. To expand the diffusion model into a robust classifier that explicitly accommodates more noise knowledge## we propose a Directional Label Diffusion (DLD) model. It disentangles the diffusion process into two paths## i.e.## directional diffusion and random diffusion. Specifically## directional diffusion simulates the corruption of true labels into a directed noise distribution## prioritizing the removal of likely noise## whereas random diffusion introduces inherent randomness to support label recovery. This architecture enable DLD to gradually infer labels from an initial random state## interpretably diverging from the specified noise distribution. To adapt the model to diverse noisy environments## we design a low-cost label pre-correction method that automatically supplies more accurate label information to the diffusion model## without requiring manual intervention or additional iterations.

33751,,2505.07209,Discovering Fine-Grained Visual-Concept Relations by Disentangled Optimal Transport Concept Bottleneck Models,Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) try to make the decision-making process transparent by exploring an intermediate concept space between the input image and the output prediction. Existing CBMs just learn coarse-grained relations between the whole image and the concepts## less considering local image information## leading to two main drawbacks: i) they often produce spurious visual-concept relations## hence decreasing model reliability; and ii) though CBMs could explain the importance of every concept to the final prediction## it is still challenging to tell which visual region produces the prediction. To solve these problems## this paper proposes a Disentangled Optimal Transport CBM (DOT-CBM) framework to explore fine-grained visual-concept relations between local image patches and concepts. Specifically## we model the concept prediction process as a transportation problem between the patches and concepts## thereby achieving explicit fine-grained feature alignment. We also incorporate orthogonal projection losses within the modality to enhance local feature disentanglement. To further address the shortcut issues caused by statistical biases in the data## we utilize the visual saliency map and concept label statistics as transportation priors. Thus## DOT-CBM can visualize inversion heatmaps## provide more reliable concept predictions## and produce more accurate class predictions. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed DOT-CBM achieves SOTA performance on several tasks## including image classification## local part detection and out-of-distribution generalization.,0,0

34023,,,Disentangling Safe and Unsafe Image Corruptions via Anisotropy and Locality,State-of-the-art machine learning systems are vulnerable to small perturbations to their input## where _small_ is defined according to a threat model that assigns a positive threat to each perturbation. Most prior works define a task-agnostic## isotropic## and global threat## like the l_p norm## where the magnitude of the perturbation fully determines the degree of the threat and neither the direction of the attack nor its position in space matter. However## common corruptions in computer vision## such as blur## compression## or occlusions## are not well captured by such treat models. This paper proposes a novel threat model called \texttt Projected Displacement  (PD) to study robustness beyond existing isotropic and global threat models. The proposed threat model measures the threat of a perturbation via its alignment with _unsafe directions_## defined as directions in the input space along which a perturbation of sufficient magnitude changes the ground truth class label. Unsafe directions are identified locally for each input based on observed training data. In this way## the PD-threat model exhibits anisotropy and locality. The PD-threat model is computationally efficient and can be easily integrated into existing robustness pipelines. Experiments on Imagenet-1k data indicate that## for any input## the set of perturbations with small PD threat includes _safe_ perturbations of large l_p norm that preserve the true label## such as noise## blur and compression## while simultaneously excluding _unsafe_ perturbations that alter the true label. Unlike perceptual threat models based on embeddings of large-vision models## the PD-threat model can be readily computed for arbitrary classification tasks without pre-training or finetuning. Further additional task information such as sensitivity to image regions or concept hierarchies can be easily integrated into the assessment of threat and thus the PD threat model presents practitioners a flexible## task-driven threat specification that alleviates the limitations of l_p-threat models.,0,0

Unlike offline video LLMs## which analyze the entire video before answering questions## active real-time interaction requires three capabilities: 1) Perception: real-time video monitoring and interaction capturing. 2) Decision: raising proactive interaction in proper situations## 3) Reaction: continuous interaction with users. However## inherent conflicts exist among the desired capabilities.

However## existing dataset distillation methods struggle with long-tailed datasets## which are prevalent in real-world scenarios. By investigating the reasons behind this unexpected result## we identified two main causes: 1) The distillation process on imbalanced datasets develops biased gradients## leading to the synthesis of similarly imbalanced distilled datasets. 2) The experts trained on such datasets perform suboptimally on tail classes## resulting in misguided distillation supervision and poor-quality soft-label initialization. To address these issues## we first propose Distribution-agnostic Matching to avoid directly matching the biased expert trajectories. It reduces the distance between the student and the biased expert trajectories and prevents the tail class bias from being distilled to the synthetic dataset. Moreover## we improve the distillation guidance with Expert Decoupling## which jointly matches the decoupled backbone and classifier to improve the tail class performance and initialize reliable soft labels.

34849,,2503.02175,DivPrune: Diversity-based Visual Token Pruning for Large Multimodal Models,Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) have emerged as powerful models capable of understanding various data modalities## including text## images## and videos. LMMs encode both text and visual data into tokens that are then combined and processed by an integrated Large Language Model (LLM). Including visual tokens substantially increases the total token count## often by thousands. The increased input length for LLM significantly raises the complexity of inference## resulting in high latency in LMMs. To address this issue## token pruning methods## which remove part of the visual tokens## are proposed. The existing token pruning methods either require extensive calibration and fine-tuning or rely on suboptimal importance metrics which results in increased redundancy among the retained tokens. In this paper## we first formulate token pruning as Max-Min Diversity Problem (MMDP) where the goal is to select a subset such that the diversity among the selected tokens is maximized. Then## we solve the MMDP to obtain the selected subset and prune the rest. The proposed method## DivPrune## reduces redundancy and achieves the highest diversity of the selected tokens. By ensuring high diversity## the selected tokens better represent the original tokens## enabling effective performance even at high pruning ratios without requiring fine-tuning. Extensive experiments with various LMMs show that DivPrune achieves state-of-the-art accuracy over 16 image- and video-language datasets. Additionally## DivPrune reduces both the end-to-end latency and GPU memory usage for the tested models.  The code is available here.,0,0
35008,,2504.07894,DiverseFlow: Sample-Efficient Diverse Mode Coverage in Flows,Many real-world applications of flow-based generative models desire a diverse set of samples that cover multiple modes of the target distribution. However## the predominant approach for obtaining diverse sets is not sample-efficient## as it involves independently obtaining many samples from the source distribution and mapping them through the flow until the desired mode coverage is achieved. As an alternative to repeated sampling## we introduce DiverseFlow: a training-free approach to improve the diversity of flow models. Our key idea is to employ a determinantal point process to induce a coupling between the samples that drives diversity under a fixed sampling budget. In essence## DiverseFlow allows exploration of more variations in a learned flow model with fewer samples. We demonstrate the efficacy of our method for tasks where sample-efficient diversity is desirable## such as text-guided image generation with polysemous words## inverse problems like large-hole inpainting## and class-conditional image synthesis.,0,0
33981,,2503.01407,Divide and Conquer: Heterogeneous Noise Integration for Diffusion-based Adversarial Purification,Existing diffusion-based purification methods aim to disrupt adversarial perturbations by introducing a certain amount of noise through a forward diffusion process## followed by a reverse process to recover clean examples. However## this approach is fundamentally flawed: the uniform operation of the forward process across all pixels compromises normal pixels while attempting to combat adversarial perturbations## resulting in the target model producing incorrect predictions. Simply relying on low-intensity noise is insufficient for effective defense. To address this critical issue## we implement a heterogeneous purification strategy grounded in the interpretability of neural networks. Our method decisively applies higher-intensity noise to specific pixels that the target model focuses on while the remaining pixels are subjected to only low-intensity noise. This requirement motivates us to redesign the sampling process of the diffusion model## allowing for the effective removal of varying noise levels. Furthermore## to evaluate our method against strong adaptative attack## our proposed method sharply reduces time cost and memory usage through a single-step resampling. The empirical evidence from extensive experiments across three datasets demonstrates that our method outperforms most current adversarial training and purification techniques by a substantial margin.,0,0

The core challenge lies in developing a versatile video tokenizer that captures both the spatial characteristics and temporal dynamics of videos to obtain representations for LLMs## and the representations can be further decoded into realistic video clips to enable video generation. In this work## we introduce Divot## a Diffusion-Powered Video Tokenizer## which leverages the diffusion process for self-supervised video representation learning. We posit that if a video diffusion model can effectively de-noise video clips by taking the features of a video tokenizer as the condition## then the tokenizer has successfully captured robust spatial and temporal information. Additionally## the video diffusion model inherently functions as a de-tokenizer## decoding videos from their representations. Building upon the Divot tokenizer## we present Divot-LLM through video-to-text autoregression and text-to-video generation by modeling the distributions of continuous-valued Divot features with a Gaussian Mixture Model. Experimental results demonstrate that our diffusion-based video tokenizer## when integrated with a pre-trained LLM## achieves competitive performance across various video comprehension and generation benchmarks.

Analogously## substantial evidence suggests that the human visual system (HVS) is influenced by the statistical distribution of colors and patterns in the natural world## characteristics also present in the training data of foundation models. The question we address in this paper is whether foundation models trained on natural images mimic some of the low-level characteristics of the human visual system## such as contrast detection## contrast masking## and contrast constancy. Specifically## we designed a protocol comprising nine test types to evaluate the image encoders of 45 foundation and generative models. Our results indicate that some foundation models (e.g.## DINO## DINOv2## and OpenCLIP)## share some of the characteristics of human vision## but other models show little resemblance. Foundation models tend to show smaller sensitivity to low contrast and rather irregular responses to contrast across frequencies. The foundation models show the best agreement with human data in terms of contrast masking. Our findings suggest that human vision and computer vision may take both similar and different paths when learning to interpret images of the real world.

Previous studies have shown that models trained on small image datasets often exploit such shortcuts## potentially impairing their generalization performance. However##  existing methods for identifying frequency shortcuts require  expensive computations and become impractical for analyzing models trained on large datasets.  In this work## we propose the first approach to more efficiently analyze frequency shortcuts at a large scale.  We show that both CNN and transformer models learn frequency shortcuts on ImageNet. We also expose that frequency shortcut solutions can yield good performance on out-of-distribution (OOD) test sets which largely retain texture information. However## these shortcuts## mostly aligned with texture patterns## hinder model generalization on rendition-based OOD test sets. These observations suggest that current OOD evaluations often overlook the impact of frequency shortcuts on model generalization. Future benchmarks could thus benefit from explicitly assessing and accounting for these shortcuts to build models that generalize across a broader range of OOD scenarios.,0,0

To synthesize these visual representations or 'imaginations'## we leverage a text-to-image diffusion model on landmark references contained in segmented instructions. These imaginations are provided to VLN agents as an added modality to act as landmark cues and an auxiliary loss is added to explicitly encourage relating these with their corresponding referring expressions. Our findings reveal an increase in success rate (SR) of ~1 point and up to ~0.5 points in success scaled by inverse path length (SPL) across agents.

33631,,2503.10065,Do We Always Need the Simplicity Bias? Looking for Optimal Inductive Biases in the Wild,Common choices of architecture give neural networks a preference for fitting data with simple functions.

Building on recent work that showed that activation functions are the origin of the simplicity bias (Teney## 2024)## we introduce a method to meta-learn activation functions to modulate this bias.**Findings.** We discover multiple tasks where the assumption of simplicity is inadequate## and standard ReLU architectures are therefore suboptimal.

Interestingly## these cases correspond to domains where neural networks have historically struggled: tabular data## regression tasks## cases of shortcut learning## and algorithmic grokking tasks. In comparison## the simplicity bias proves adequate on image tasks## where learned activations are nearly identical to ReLUs and GeLUs.**Implications.** (1) Contrary to common belief## the simplicity bias is not universally useful.

34881,,2503.18371,Do Your Best and Get Enough Rest for Continual Learning,According to the forgetting curve theory## we can enhance memory retention by learning extensive data and taking adequate rest. This means that in order to effectively retain new knowledge## it is essential to learn it thoroughly and ensure sufficient rest so that our brain can memorize without forgetting. The main takeaway from this theory is that learning extensive data at once necessitates sufficient rest before learning the same data again. This aspect of human long-term memory retention can be effectively utilized to address the continual learning of neural networks. Retaining new knowledge for a long period of time without catastrophic forgetting is the critical problem of continual learning. Therefore## based on Ebbinghaus' theory## we introduce the view-batch model that adjusts the learning schedules to optimize the recall interval between retraining the same samples. The proposed view-batch model allows the network to get enough rest to learn extensive knowledge from the same samples with a recall interval of sufficient length. To this end## we specifically present two approaches: 1) a replay method that guarantees the optimal recall interval## and 2) a self-supervised learning that acquires extensive knowledge from a single training sample at a time. We empirically show that these approaches of our method are aligned with the forgetting curve theory## which can enhance long-term memory.

34987,,2504.04566,DyCON: Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Consistency and Contrastive Learning for Semi-supervised Medical Image Segmentation,Semi-supervised learning in medical image segmentation leverages unlabeled data to reduce annotation burdens through consistency learning. However## current methods struggle with class imbalance and high uncertainty from pathology variations## leading to inaccurate segmentation in 3D medical images. To address these challenges## we present DyCON## a Dynamic Uncertainty-aware Consistency and Contrastive Learning framework that enhances the generalization of consistency methods with two complementary losses: Uncertainty-aware Consistency Loss (UnCL) and Focal Entropy-aware Contrastive Loss (FeCL). UnCL enforces global consistency by dynamically weighting the contribution of each voxel to the consistency loss based on its uncertainty## preserving high-uncertainty regions instead of filtering them out. Initially## UnCL prioritizes learning from uncertain voxels with lower penalties## encouraging the model to explore challenging regions. As training progress## the penalty shift towards confident voxels to refine predictions and ensure global consistency. Meanwhile## FeCL enhances local feature discrimination in imbalanced regions by introducing dual focal mechanisms and adaptive confidence adjustments into the contrastive principle. These mechanisms jointly prioritizes hard positives and negatives while focusing on uncertain sample pairs## effectively capturing subtle lesion variations under class imbalance. Extensive evaluations on four diverse medical image segmentation datasets (ISLES'22## BraTS'19## LA## Pancreas) show DyCON's superior performance against SOTA methods(\href https://dycon25.github.io/) Project Page: https://dycon25.github.io/  .,0,0

Based on our approaches## we develop MultiHeadDepth (replacing cost volume) and HomoDepth (MultiHeadDepth + removing pre-processing) models. MultiHeadDepth provides 11.8-30.3% improvements in accuracy and 22.9-25.2% reduction in latency compared to a state-of-the-art depth estimation model for AR glasses from industry. HomoDepth## which can directly process unrectified images## reduces the end-to-end latency by 44.5%.

34805,,,Electromyography-Informed Facial Expression Reconstruction for Physiological-Based Synthesis and Analysis,The relationship between muscle activity and resulting facial expressions is crucial for various fields## including psychology## medicine## and entertainment. The synchronous recording of facial mimicry and muscular activity via surface electromyography (sEMG) provides a unique window into these complex dynamics. Unfortunately## existing methods for facial analysis cannot handle electrode occlusion## rendering them ineffective.  Even with occlusion-free reference images of the same person## variations in expression intensity and execution are unmatchable. Our electromyography-informed facial expression reconstruction (EIFER) approach is a novel method to restore faces under sEMG occlusion faithfully in an adversarial manner. We decouple facial geometry and visual appearance (e.g.## skin texture## lighting## electrodes) by combining a 3D Morphable Model (3DMM) with neural unpaired image-to-image translation via reference recordings. Then## EIFER learns a bidirectional mapping between 3DMM expression parameters and muscle activity## establishing correspondence between the two domains. We validate the effectiveness of our approach through experiments on a dataset of synchronized sEMG recordings and facial mimicry## demonstrating faithful geometry and appearance reconstruction. Further## we synthesize expressions based on muscle activity and how observed expressions can predict dynamic muscle activity. Consequently## EIFER introduces a new paradigm for facial electromyography## which could be extended to other forms of multi-modal face recordings.,0,0

Prompt selection is critical in VICL## but current methods assume the existence of a single 'ideal' prompt in a pool of candidates## which in practice may not hold true. Multiple suitable prompts may exist## but individually they often fall short## leading to difficulties in selection and the exclusion of useful context.

The existing methods have two primary deficiencies: (1) They struggle to simultaneously hold audio-visual sync and achieve clear pronunciation; (2) They lack the capacity to express user-defined emotions. To address these problems## we propose EmoDubber## an emotion-controllable dubbing architecture that allows users to specify emotion type and emotional intensity while satisfying high-quality lip sync and pronunciation. Specifically## we first design Lip-related Prosody Aligning (LPA)## which focuses on learning the inherent consistency between lip motion and prosody variation by duration level contrastive learning to incorporate reasonable alignment.

Next## the speaker identity adapting module decodes acoustics prior and inject the speaker style embedding. After that## the proposed Flow-based User Emotion Controlling (FUEC) is used to synthesize waveform by flow matching prediction network conditioned on acoustics prior. In this process## the FUEC determines the gradient direction and guidance scale based on the user's emotion instructions by the positive and negative guidance mechanism## which focuses on amplifying the desired emotion while suppressing others.

In this paper## we propose EDF (emphasizes the discriminative features)## a dataset distillation method that enhances key discriminative regions in synthetic images using Grad-CAM activation maps. Our approach is inspired by a key observation: in simple datasets## high-activation areas typically occupy most of the image## whereas in complex scenarios## the size of these areas is much smaller. Unlike previous methods that treat all pixels equally when synthesizing images## EDF uses Grad-CAM activation maps to enhance high-activation areas. From a supervision perspective## we downplay supervision signals produced by lower trajectory-matching losses## as they contain common patterns. Additionally## to help the DD community better explore complex scenarios## we build the Complex Dataset Distillation (Comp-DD) benchmark by meticulously selecting sixteen subsets## eight easy and eight hard## from ImageNet-1K. In particular## EDF consistently outperforms SOTA results in complex scenarios## such as ImageNet-1K subsets.

32997,,2412.11102,Empowering LLMs to Understand and Generate Complex Vector Graphics,The unprecedented advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have profoundly impacted natural language processing but have yet to fully embrace the realm of scalable vector graphics (SVG) generation. While LLMs encode partial knowledge of SVG data from web pages during training## recent findings suggest that semantically ambiguous and tokenized representations within LLMs may result in hallucinations in vector primitive predictions. Additionally## LLM training typically lacks modeling and understanding of the rendering sequence of vector paths## which can lead to occlusion between output vector primitives. In this paper## we present LLM4SVG## an initial yet substantial step toward bridging this gap by enabling LLMs to better understand and generate vector graphics. LLM4SVG facilitates a deeper understanding of SVG components through learnable semantic tokens## which precisely encode these tokens and their corresponding properties to generate semantically aligned SVG outputs. Using a series of learnable semantic tokens## a structured dataset for instruction following is developed to support comprehension and generation across two primary tasks. Our method introduces a modular architecture to existing large language models## integrating semantic tags## vector instruction encoders## fine-tuned commands## and powerful LLMs to tightly combine geometric## appearance## and language information. To overcome the scarcity of SVG-text instruction data## we developed an automated data generation pipeline that collected our SVGX-SFT Dataset## consisting of high-quality human-designed SVGs and 580k SVG instruction following data specifically crafted for LLM training## which facilitated the adoption of the supervised fine-tuning strategy popular in LLM development. By exploring various training strategies## we developed LLM4SVG## which significantly moves beyond optimized rendering-based approaches and language-model-based baselines to achieve remarkable results in human evaluation tasks.

34361,,2503.18817,Enhanced OoD Detection through Cross-Modal Alignment of Multi-Modal Representations,Prior research on out-of-distribution detection (OoDD) has primarily focused on single-modality models. Recently## with the advent of large-scale pretrained vision-language models such as CLIP## OoDD methods utilizing such multi-modal representations through zero-shot and prompt learning strategies have emerged. However## these methods typically involve either freezing the pretrained weights or only partially tuning them## which can be suboptimal for downstream datasets. In this paper## we highlight that multi-modal fine-tuning (MMFT) can achieve notable OoDD performance. Despite some recent works demonstrating the impact of fine-tuning methods for OoDD## there remains significant potential for performance improvement. We investigate the limitation of naive fine-tuning methods## examining why they fail to fully leverage the pretrained knowledge. Our empirical analysis suggests that this issue could stem from the modality gap within in-distribution (ID) embeddings. To address this## we propose a training objective that enhances cross-modal alignment by regularizing the distances between image and text embeddings of ID data. This adjustment helps in better utilizing pretrained textual information by aligning similar semantics from different modalities (i.e.## text and image) more closely in the hyperspherical representation space. We theoretically demonstrate that the proposed regularization corresponds to the maximum likelihood estimation of an energy-based model on a hypersphere.

34796,,,EquiPose: Exploiting Permutation Equivariance for Relative Camera Pose Estimation,Relative camera pose estimation between two images is a fundamental task in 3D computer vision. Recently## many relative pose estimation networks have been explored for learning a mapping from two input images to their corresponding relative pose## however## the estimated relative poses by these methods do not have the intrinsic Pose Permutation Equivariance (PPE) property: the estimated relative pose from Image A to Image B should be the inverse of that from Image B to Image A.

To address this problem## we firstly introduce the concept of PPE mapping## which indicates such a mapping that captures the intrinsic PPE property of relative poses. Then by enforcing the aforementioned PPE property## we propose a general framework for relative pose estimation## called EquiPose## which could easily accommodate various relative pose estimation networks in literature as its baseline models. We further theoretically prove that the proposed EquiPose framework could guarantee that its obtained mapping is a PPE mapping. Given a pre-trained baseline model## the proposed EquiPose framework could improve its performance even without fine-tuning## and could further boost its performance with fine-tuning. Experimental results on four public datasets demonstrate that EquiPose could significantly improve the performances of various state-of-the-art models.,0,0

To address these issues## we propose a novel method that leverages the semantic knowledge from the Segment Anything Model (SAM) to grow the quality of fusion results and enable downstream task adaptability## namely SAGE. Specifically## we design a Semantic Persistent Attention (SPA) Module that efficiently maintains source information via the persistent repository while extracting high-level semantic priors from SAM. More importantly## to eliminate the impractical dependence on SAM during inference## we introduce a bi-level optimization-driven distillation mechanism with triplet losses## which allow the student network to effectively extract knowledge. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves a balance between high-quality visual results and downstream task adaptability while maintaining practical deployment efficiency.

34843,,2406.04295,Everything to the Synthetic: Diffusion-driven Test-time Adaptation via Synthetic-Domain Alignment,Test-time adaptation (TTA) aims to improve the performance of source-domain pre-trained models on previously unseen## shifted target domains. Traditional TTA methods primarily adapt model weights based on target data streams## making model performance sensitive to the amount and order of target data. The recently proposed diffusion-driven TTA methods mitigate this by adapting model inputs instead of weights## where an unconditional diffusion model## trained on the source domain## transforms target-domain data into a synthetic domain that is expected to approximate the source domain. However## in this paper## we reveal that although the synthetic data in diffusion-driven TTA seems indistinguishable from the source data## it is unaligned with## or even markedly different from the latter for deep networks. To address this issue## we propose a Synthetic-Domain Alignment (SDA) framework. Our key insight is to fine-tune the source model with synthetic data to ensure better alignment. Specifically## we first employ a conditional diffusion model to generate labeled samples## creating a synthetic dataset. Subsequently## we use the aforementioned unconditional diffusion model to add noise to and denoise each sample before fine-tuning. This Mix of Diffusion (MoD) process mitigates the potential domain misalignment between the conditional and unconditional models. Extensive experiments across classifiers## segmenters## and multimodal large language models (MLLMs## e.g.## LLaVA) demonstrate that SDA achieves superior domain alignment and consistently outperforms existing diffusion-driven TTA methods.

Recently## 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has garnered significant attention for its high-quality rendering and fast inference speed. Yet## due to the unstructured and irregular nature of Gaussian point clouds## ensuring accurate geometry reconstruction remains difficult. Existing methods primarily focus on geometry regularization## with common approaches including primitive-based and dual-model frameworks.

However## due to the low resolution and unclear parcel boundaries## annotating pixel-level masks is exceptionally complex and time-consuming in SITS. This paper embraces the weakly supervised paradigm (i.e.## only image-level categories available) to liberate the crop mapping task from the exhaustive annotation burden. The unique characteristics of SITS give rise to several challenges in weakly supervised learning: (1) noise perturbation from spatially neighboring regions## and (2) erroneous semantic bias from anomalous temporal periods. To address the above difficulties## we propose a novel method## termed exploring space-time perceptive clues (Exact). First## we introduce a set of spatial clues to explicitly capture the representative patterns of different crops from the most class-relative regions. Besides## we leverage the temporal-to-class interaction of the model to emphasize the contributions of pivotal clips## thereby enhancing the model perception for crop regions. Build upon the space-time perceptive clues## we derive the clue-based CAMs to effectively supervise the SITS segmentation network. Our method demonstrates impressive performance on various SITS benchmarks. Remarkably## the segmentation network trained on  Exact-generated masks achieves 95% of its fully supervised performance## showing the bright promise of weakly supervised paradigm in crop mapping scenario.,0,0

Our research tackles this challenge by developing an explainable saliency (XSal) model that not only identifies what is important in an image## but also explains its choices in a way that makes sense to humans. We achieve this by using vision-language models to reason about images and by focusing the model's attention on the most crucial information using a contextual prioritization mechanism. Unlike prior approaches that rely on fixation descriptions or soft-attention based semantic aggregation## our method directly models the reasoning steps involved in saliency prediction## generating selectively prioritized explanations clarify why specific regions are prioritized.

Then## we introduce a novel plug-in domain descriptor orthogonality (DDO) regularizer to mitigate the impact of these domain-specific concepts on the final predictions. Notably## the DDO regularizer is agnostic to the design of conceptbased models and we integrate it into several prevailing models. Through evaluation of domain generalization on four standard benchmarks and three newly introduced benchmarks## we demonstrate that DDO can significantly improve the out-of-distribution (OOD) generalization over the previous state-of-the-art concept-based models.

34429,,,Explaining in Diffusion: Explaining a Classifier with Diffusion Semantics,Classifiers are important components in many computer vision tasks## serving as the foundational backbone of a wide variety of models employed across diverse applications. However## understanding the decision-making process of classifiers remains a significant challenge.  We propose DiffEx## a novel method that leverages the capabilities of text-to-image diffusion models to explain classifier decisions.

32848,,,Explicit Depth-Aware Blurry Video Frame Interpolation Guided by Differential Curves,Blurry video frame interpolation (BVFI)## which aims to generate high-frame-rate clear videos from low-frame-rate blurry inputs## is a challenging yet significant task in computer vision. Current state-of-the-art approaches typically rely on linear or quadratic models to estimate intermediate motion. However## these methods often overlook depth variations that occur during fast object motion## leading to changes in object size and hindering interpolation performance. This paper proposes the Differential Curves-guided Blurry Video Frame Interpolation (DC-BVFI) framework## which leverages the differential curves theory to analyze and mitigate the effects of depth variations caused by object motion. Specifically## DC-BVFI consists of UBNet and MPNet. Unlike prior approaches that rely on optical flow for frame interpolation## MPNet is designed to estimate the 3D scene flow## which facilitates a more precise awareness of depth and velocity variations. Since scene flow cannot be directly inferred in the 2D frame space## UBNet is introduced to transform them into 3D point maps.

Traditional methods often segment videos frame-by-frame or in a short temporal window## leading to limited temporal context## redundant computations## and heavy memory requirements. To this end## we introduce a Temporal Video State Space Sharing (TV3S) architecture to leverage Mamba state space models for temporal feature sharing.

33998,,2504.02515,Exploration-Driven Generative Interactive Environments,Modern world models require costly and time-consuming collection of large video datasets with action demonstrations by people or by environment-specific agents. To simplify training## we focus on using many virtual environments for inexpensive## automatically collected interaction data. Genie## a recent multi-environment world model## demonstrates simulation abilities of many environments with shared behavior. Unfortunately## training their model requires expensive demonstrations. Therefore## we propose a training framework merely using a random agent in virtual environments. While the model trained in this manner exhibits good controls## it is limited by the random exploration possibilities. To address this limitation## we propose AutoExplore Agent - an exploration agent that entirely relies on the uncertainty of the world model## delivering diverse data from which it can learn the best. Our agent is fully independent of environment-specific rewards and thus adapts easily to new environments. With this approach## the pretrained multi-environment model can quickly adapt to new environments achieving video fidelity and controllability improvement. In order to obtain automatically large-scale interaction datasets for pretraining## we group environments with similar behavior and controls. To this end## we annotate the behavior and controls of 974 virtual environments - a dataset that we name RetroAct.

Recently## Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) has been introduced in WSSS. However## recent methods primarily focus on image-text alignment for CAM generation## while CLIP's potential in patch-text alignment remains unexplored. In this work## we propose ExCEL to explore CLIP's dense knowledge via a novel patch-text alignment paradigm for WSSS. Specifically## we propose Text Semantic Enrichment (TSE) and Visual Calibration (VC) modules to improve the dense alignment across both text and vision modalities. To make text embeddings semantically informative## our TSE module applies Large Language Models (LLMs) to build a dataset-wide knowledge base and enriches the text representations with an implicit attribute-hunting process.

However## the requirement for fine-grained attribute understanding poses challenges for prior arts## as they struggle to accurately align attribute information with correct visual patterns. Given the proven importance of 'visual density'## it is presumed that the limitations of current REC approaches stem from an under-exploration of 'contextual attribute density' (CAD). In the scope of REC## we define the CAD as the measure of the information intensity of one certain fine-grained attribute in visual regions. To model the the CAD## we propose a U-shape CAD estimator in which referring expression and multi-scale visual features from GroundingDINO can interact with each other. With additional density supervisions## we can effectively encode CAD## which is subsequently decoded via a novel attention procedure with CAD-refined queries. Integrating all these contributions## our framework significantly outperforms state-of-the-art REC methods## achieves 30% error reduction in counting metics and a 10% improvement in localization accuracy.

32783,,2503.02424,Exploring Intrinsic Normal Prototypes within a Single Image for Universal Anomaly Detection,Anomaly detection (AD) is essential for industrial inspection## yet existing methods typically rely on 'comparing' test images to normal references from a training set. However## variations in appearance and positioning often complicate the alignment of these references with the test image## limiting detection accuracy. We observe that most anomalies manifest as local variations## meaning that even within anomalous images## valuable normal information remains. We argue that this information is useful and may be more aligned with the anomalies since both the anomalies and the normal information originate from the same image. Therefore## rather than relying on external normality from the training set## we propose INP-Former## a novel method that extracts Intrinsic Normal Prototypes (INPs) directly from the test image. Specifically## we introduce the INP Extractor## which linearly combines normal tokens to represent INPs. We further propose an INP Coherence Loss to ensure INPs can faithfully represent normality for the testing image. These INPs then guide the INP-Guided Decoder to reconstruct only normal tokens## with reconstruction errors serving as anomaly scores. Additionally## we propose a Soft Mining Loss to prioritize hard-to-optimize samples during training. INP-Former achieves state-of-the-art performance in single-class## multi-class## and few-shot AD tasks across MVTec-AD## VisA## and Real-IAD## positioning it as a versatile and universal solution for AD.

33762,,2408.11280,Exploring Scene Affinity for Semi-Supervised LiDAR Semantic Segmentation,This paper explores scene affinity (AIScene)## namely intra-scene consistency and inter-scene correlation## for semi-supervised LiDAR semantic segmentation in driving scenes. Adopting teacher-student training## AIScene employs a teacher network to generate pseudo-labeled scenes from unlabeled data## which then supervise the student network's learning. Unlike most methods that include all points in pseudo-labeled scenes for forward propagation but only pseudo-labeled points for backpropagation## AIScene removes points without pseudo-labels## ensuring consistency in both forward and backward propagation within the scene. This simple point erasure strategy effectively prevents unsupervised## semantically ambiguous points (excluded in backpropagation) from affecting the learning of pseudo-labeled points. Moreover## AIScene incorporates patch-based data augmentation## mixing multiple scenes at both scene and instance levels. Compared to existing augmentation techniques that typically perform scene-level mixing between two scenes## our method enhances the semantic diversity of labeled (or pseudo-labeled) scenes## thereby improving the semi-supervised performance of segmentation models. Experiments show that AIScene outperforms previous methods on two popular benchmarks across four settings## achieving notable improvements of 1.9% and 2.1% in the most challenging 1% labeled data.

However## most existing GAN-based SR methods typically perform coarse-grained discrimination directly on images and ignore the semantic information of images## making it challenging for the super resolution networks (SRN) to learn fine-grained and semantic-related texture details. To alleviate this issue## we propose a semantic feature discrimination method## SFD## for perceptual SR. Specifically## we first design a feature discriminator (Feat-D)## to discriminate the pixel-wise middle semantic features from CLIP## aligning the feature distributions of SR images with that of high-quality images. Additionally## we propose a text-guided discrimination method (TG-D) by introducing learnable prompt pairs (LPP) in an adversarial manner to perform discrimination on the more abstract output feature of CLIP## further enhancing the discriminative ability of our method. With both Feat-D and TG-D## our SFD can effectively distinguish between the semantic feature distributions of low-quality and high-quality images## encouraging SRN to generate more realistic and semantic-relevant textures. Furthermore## based on the trained Feat-D and LPP## we propose a novel opinion-unaware no-reference image quality assessment (OU NR-IQA) method## SFD-IQA## greatly improving OU NR-IQA performance without any additional targeted training.

In this paper## we comprehensively evaluate state-of-the-art grounding LMMs across a suite of multimodal question-answering benchmarks## observing drastic performance drops that indicate vanishing general knowledge comprehension and weakened instruction following ability. To address this issue## we present F-LMM---grounding frozen off-the-shelf LMMs in human-AI conversations---a straightforward yet effective design based on the fact that word-pixel correspondences conducive to visual grounding inherently exist in the attention mechanism of well-trained LMMs. Using only a few trainable CNN layers## we can translate word-pixel attention weights to mask logits## which a SAM-based mask refiner can further optimise. Our F-LMM neither learns special segmentation tokens nor utilises high-quality grounded instruction-tuning data## but achieves competitive performance on referring expression segmentation and panoptic narrative grounding benchmarks while completely preserving LMMs' original conversational ability. Additionally## with instruction-following ability preserved and grounding ability obtained## F-LMM can be directly applied to complex tasks like reasoning segmentation## grounded conversation generation and visual chain-of-thought reasoning.

However## their slow inference speed limits practical applications. Despite the development of various distillation techniques for diffusion models## we found that naive diffusion distillation methods do not yield satisfactory results. Distilled models exhibit reduced robustness with open-set input images and a decreased correlation between audio and video compared to teacher models## undermining the advantages of diffusion models. To address this## we propose FADA (Fast Diffusion Avatar Synthesis with Mixed-Supervised Multi-CFG Distillation).

However## conventional approaches using image diffusion models fall short in handling video dynamics## particularly for challenging temporal edits like motion adjustments. While current video diffusion models produce high-quality results## adapting them for efficient editing remains difficult due to the heavy computational demands that prevent the direct application of previous image editing techniques. To overcome these limitations## we introduce FADE--a training-free yet highly effective video editing approach that fully leverages the inherent priors from pre-trained video diffusion models via frequency-aware factorization. Rather than simply using these models## we first analyze the attention patterns within the video model to reveal how video priors are distributed across different components. Building on these insights## we propose a factorization strategy to optimize each component's specialized role. Furthermore## we devise spectrum-guided modulation to refine the sampling trajectory with frequency domain cues## preventing information leakage and supporting efficient## versatile edits while preserving the basic spatial and temporal structure.

34425,,,F^3OCUS - Federated Finetuning of Vision-Language Foundation Models with Optimal Client Layer Updating Strategy via Multi-objective Meta-Heuristics,Effective training of large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) on resource-constrained client devices in Federated Learning (FL) requires the usage of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) strategies. To this end## we demonstrate the impact of two factors## viz.## client-specific layer importance score that selects the most important VLM layers for fine-tuning and inter-client layer diversity score that encourages diverse layer selection across clients for optimal VLM layer selection. We first theoretically motivate and leverage the principal eigenvalue magnitude of layerwise Neural Tangent Kernels and show its effectiveness as client-specific layer importance score. Next## we propose a novel layer updating strategy dubbed F^3OCUS that jointly optimizes the layer importance and diversity factors by employing a data-free## multi-objective## meta-heuristic optimization on the server. We explore 5 different meta-heuristic algorithms and compare their effectiveness for selecting model layers and adapter layers towards PEFT-FL. Furthermore## we release a new MedVQA-FL dataset involving overall 707##962 VQA triplets and 9 modality-specific clients and utilize it to train and evaluate our method. Overall## we conduct more than 10##000 client-level experiments on 6 Vision-Language FL task settings involving 58 medical image datasets and 4 different VLM architectures of varying sizes to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

33130,,,Face Forgery Video Detection via Temporal Forgery Cue Unraveling,Face Forgery Video Detection (FFVD) is a critical yet challenging task in determining whether a digital facial video is authentic or forged. Existing FFVD methods typically focus on isolated spatial or coarsely fused spatiotemporal information## failing to leverage temporal forgery cues thus resulting in unsatisfactory performance. We strive to unravel these cues across three progressive levels: momentary anomaly## gradual inconsistency## and cumulative distortion. Accordingly## we design a consecutive correlate module to capture momentary anomaly cues by correlating interactions among consecutive frames. Then## we devise a future guide module to unravel inconsistency cues by iteratively aggregating historical anomaly cues and gradually propagating them into future frames. Finally## we introduce a historical review module that unravels distortion cues via momentum accumulation from future to historical frames. These three modules form our Temporal Forgery Cue Unraveling (TFCU) framework## sequentially highlighting spatial discriminative features by unraveling temporal forgery cues bidirectionally between historical and future frames.

32887,,2412.13303,FastVLM: Efficient Vision Encoding for Vision Language Models,Vision Language Models (VLMs) like LLaVA encode images into tokens aligned to the word embedding space of the LLM decoder. Scaling input image resolution is essential for improving performance## especially in text-rich image understanding tasks. However## popular visual encoders such as CLIP-pretrained ViTs become inefficient at high resolutions due to the large number of tokens and high encoding latency caused by stacked self-attention layers. At different operational resolutions## the vision encoder of a VLM can be optimized along two axes: reducing encoding latency and minimizing the number of visual tokens passed to the LLM## thereby lowering overall latency. In this work## we introduce FastVLM## which achieves an optimized trade-off between resolution## latency## and accuracy by incorporating FastViTHD--a new hybrid vision encoder that outputs fewer tokens and significantly reduces encoding time while processing high-resolution images. We provide a comprehensive efficiency analysis of the interplay between image resolution## vision latency## number of visual tokens## and LLM size. In the LLaVA-1.5 setup## we achieve 3.2x improvement in overall time-to-first-token (TTFT) while maintaining similar performance on VLM benchmarks compared to prior works. On text-rich evaluations like TextVQA and DocVQA## FastVLM obtains +8.4% and +12.5% better accuracy than ConvLLaVA at a similar operating point of 144 visual tokens.

Additionally## the disentanglement of 3DGS parameters - geometry (x## a## S) and texture (c) - enables separate analysis of texture and geometry awareness. Under Feat2GS## we conduct extensive experiments to probe the 3D awareness of several VFMs## and investigate the ingredients that lead to a 3D aware VFM.

We particularly explore retrieval-augmented learning (RAL)## which retrieves open data## e.g.## the VLM's pretraining dataset## to learn models for better serving downstream tasks. RAL has been studied in zero-shot recognition but remains under-explored in FSR. Although applying RAL to FSR may seem straightforward## we observe interesting and novel challenges and opportunities. First## somewhat surprisingly## finetuning a VLM on a large amount of retrieved data underperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot methods. This is due to the imbalanced distribution of retrieved data and its domain gaps with the few-shot examples in the downstream task. Second## more surprisingly## we find that simply finetuning a VLM solely on few-shot examples significantly outperforms previous FSR methods## and finetuning on the mix of retrieved and few-shot data yields even better results. Third## to mitigate the imbalanced distribution and domain gap issues## we propose Stage-Wise retrieval-Augmented fineTuning (SWAT)## which involves end-to-end finetuning on mixed data in the first stage and retraining the classifier on the few-shot data in the second stage. Extensive experiments on nine popular benchmarks demonstrate that SWAT significantly outperforms previous methods by >6% accuracy.,0,0
33547,,2501.01601,Few-shot Implicit Function Generation via Equivariance,Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) have emerged as a powerful framework for representing continuous signals. However## generating diverse INR weights remains challenging due to limited training data. We introduce Few-shot Implicit Function Generation## a new problem setup that aims to generate diverse yet functionally consistent INR weights from only a few examples. This is challenging because even for the same signal## the optimal INRs can vary significantly depending on their initializations. To tackle this## we propose EquiGen## a framework that can generate new INRs from limited data. The core idea is that functionally similar networks can be transformed into one another through weight permutations## forming an equivariance group. By projecting these weights into an equivariant latent space## we enable diverse generation within these groups## even with few examples. EquiGen implements this through an equivariant encoder trained via contrastive learning and smooth augmentation## an equivariance-guided diffusion process## and controlled perturbations in the equivariant subspace. Experiments on 2D image and 3D shape INR datasets demonstrate that our approach effectively generates diverse INR weights while preserving their functional properties in few-shot scenarios.

However## existing methods for training scanpath prediction models are data-intensive and cannot be effectively personalized to new individuals with only a few available examples. In this paper## we propose few-shot personalized scanpath prediction task (FS-PSP) and a novel method to address it## which aims to predict scanpaths for an unseen subject using minimal support data of that subject's scanpath behavior. The key to our method's adaptability is the Subject-Embedding Network (SE-Net)## specifically designed to capture unique## individualized representations for each subject's scanpaths. SE-Net generates subject embeddings that effectively distinguish between subjects while minimizing variability among scanpaths from the same individual. The personalized scanpath prediction model is then conditioned on these subject embeddings to produce accurate## personalized results. Experiments on multiple eye-tracking datasets demonstrate that our method excels in FS-PSP settings and does not require any fine-tuning steps at test time.

34453,,2411.18970,FiRe: Fixed-points of Restoration Priors for Solving Inverse Problems,Selecting an appropriate prior to compensate for information loss due to the measurement operator is a fundamental challenge in imaging inverse problems. Implicit priors based on denoising neural networks have become central to widely-used frameworks such as Plug-and-Play (PnP) algorithms. In this work## we introduce Fixed-points of Restoration (FiRe) priors as a new framework for expanding the notion of priors in PnP to general restoration models beyond traditional denoising models. The key insight behind FiRe is that smooth images emerge as fixed points of the composition of a degradation operator with the corresponding restoration model. This enables us to derive an explicit formula for our implicit prior by quantifying invariance of images under this composite operation. Adopting this fixed-point perspective## we show how various restoration networks can effectively serve as priors for solving inverse problems. The FiRe framework further enables ensemble-like combinations of multiple restoration models as well as acquisition-informed restoration networks## all within a unified optimization approach. Experimental results validate the effectiveness of FiRe across various inverse problems## establishing a new paradigm for incorporating pretrained restoration models into PnP-like algorithms.

34872,,2503.07591,Filter Images First## Generate Instructions Later: Pre-Instruction Data Selection for Visual Instruction Tuning,Visual instruction tuning (VIT) for large vision-language models (LVLMs) requires training on expansive datasets of image-instruction pairs## which can be costly. Recent efforts in VIT data selection aim to select a small subset of high-quality image-instruction pairs## reducing VIT runtime while maintaining performance comparable to full-scale training. However## a major challenge often overlooked is that generating instructions from unlabeled images for VIT is highly expensive. Most existing VIT datasets rely heavily on human annotations or paid services like the GPT API## which limits users with constrained resources from creating VIT datasets for custom applications. To address this## we introduce Pre-Instruction Data Selection (PreSel)## a more practical data selection paradigm that directly selects the most beneficial unlabeled images and generates instructions only for the selected images. PreSel first estimates the relative importance of each vision task within VIT datasets to derive task-wise sampling budgets. It then clusters image features within each task## selecting the most representative images with the budget. This approach reduces computational overhead for both instruction generation during VIT data formation and LVLM fine-tuning. By generating instructions for only 15% of the images## PreSel achieves performance comparable to full-data VIT on the LLaVA-1.5 and Vision-Flan datasets.

34993,,2502.19754,Finding Local Diffusion Schrodinger Bridge using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network,In image generation## Schrodinger Bridge (SB)-based methods theoretically enhance the efficiency and quality compared to the diffusion models by finding the least costly path between two distributions. However## they are computationally expensive and time-consuming when applied to complex image data. The reason is that they focus on fitting globally optimal paths in high-dimensional spaces## directly generating images as next step on the path using complex networks through self-supervised training## which typically results in a gap with the global optimum. Meanwhile## most diffusion models are in the same path subspace generated by weights f_A(t) and f_B(t)## as they follow the paradigm (x_t = f_A(t)x_ Img  + f_B(t)epsilon). To address the limitations of SB-based methods## this paper proposes for the first time to find local Diffusion Schrodinger Bridges (LDSB) in the diffusion path subspace## which strengthens the connection between the SB problem and diffusion models. Specifically## our method optimizes the diffusion paths using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN)## which has the advantage of resistance to forgetting and continuous output. The experiment shows that our LDSB significantly improves the quality and efficiency of image generation using the same pre-trained denoising network and the KAN for optimising is only less than 0.1MB.

To address this## we propose FADE (Fine-grained Attenuation for Diffusion Erasure)## introducing adjacency-aware unlearning in diffusion models. FADE comprises two components: (1) the Concept Neighborhood## which identifies an adjacency set of related concepts## and (2) Mesh Modules## employing a structured combination of Expungement## Adjacency## and Guidance loss components.

To address these issues## we propose PartCATSeg## a novel framework that integrates object-aware part-level cost aggregation## compositional loss## and structural guidance from DINO. Our approach employs a disentangled cost aggregation strategy that handles object and part-level costs separately## enhancing the precision of part-level segmentation. We also introduce a compositional loss to better capture part-object relationships## compensating for the limited part annotations. Additionally## structural guidance from DINO features improves boundary delineation and inter-part understanding.

32839,,,FineLIP: Extending CLIP's Reach via Fine-Grained Alignment with Longer Text Inputs,As a pioneering vision-language model## CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training) has achieved significant success across various domains and a wide range of downstream vision-language tasks. However## the text encoders in popular CLIP models are limited to processing only 77 text tokens## which constrains their ability to effectively handle longer## detail-rich captions. Additionally## CLIP models often struggle to effectively capture detailed visual and textual information## which hampers their performance on tasks that require fine-grained analysis. To address these limitations## we present a novel approach## FineLIP## that extends the capabilities of CLIP. FineLIP enhances cross-modal text-image mapping by incorporating Fine-grained alignment with Longer text input within the CLIP-style framework. FineLIP first extends the positional embeddings to handle longer text## followed by the dynamic aggregation of local image and text tokens. The aggregated results are then used to enforce fine-grained token-to-token cross-modal alignment. We validate our model on datasets with long## detailed captions across two tasks: zero-shot cross-modal retrieval and text-to-image generation. Quantitative and qualitative experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of FineLIP## outperforming existing state-of-the-art approaches.

32532,,,Finer-CAM: Spotting the Difference Reveals Finer Details for Visual Explanation,Class activation map (CAM) has been widely used to highlight image regions that contribute to class predictions. Despite its simplicity and computational efficiency## CAM often struggles to identify discriminative regions that distinguish visually similar fine-grained classes. Prior efforts address this limitation by introducing more sophisticated explanation processes## but at the cost of extra complexity. In this paper## we propose Finer-CAM## a method that retains CAM's efficiency while achieving precise localization of discriminative regions. Our key insight is that the deficiency of CAM lies not in 'how' it explains## but in 'what' it explains. Specifically## previous methods attempt to identify all cues contributing to the target class's logit value## which inadvertently also activates regions predictive of visually similar classes. By explicitly comparing the target class with similar classes and spotting their differences## Finer-CAM suppresses features shared with other classes and emphasizes the unique## discriminative details of the target class. Finer-CAM is easy to implement## compatible with various CAM methods## and can be extended to multi-modal models for accurate localization of specific concepts. Additionally## Finer-CAM allows adjustable comparison strength## enabling users to selectively highlight coarse object contours or fine discriminative details. Quantitatively## we show that masking out the top 5% of activated pixels by Finer-CAM results in a larger relative confidence drop compared to baselines.

34971,,,Finsler Multi-Dimensional Scaling: Manifold Learning for Asymmetric Dimensionality Reduction and Embedding,Dimensionality reduction is a fundamental task that aims to simplify complex data by reducing its feature dimensionality while preserving essential patterns## with core applications in data analysis and visualisation. To preserve the underlying data structure## multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) methods focus on preserving pairwise dissimilarities## such as distances. They optimise the embedding to have pairwise distances as close as possible to the data dissimilarities. However## the current standard is limited to embedding data in Riemannian manifolds. Motivated by the lack of asymmetry in the Riemannian metric of the embedding space## this paper extends the MDS problem to a natural asymmetric generalisation of Riemannian manifolds called Finsler manifolds.

However## they still face challenges in three key areas: 1) complex scenarios; 2) semantic consistency; and 3) fine-grained editing. To address these issues## we propose FireEdit## an innovative Fine-grained Instruction-based image editing framework that exploits a REgion-aware VLM. FireEdit is designed to accurately comprehend user instructions and ensure effective control over the editing process.

Therefore## we propose a Time-Aware Target Injection module and a Hybrid Visual Cross Attention module. The former dynamically adjusts the guidance strength at various denoising stages by integrating timestep embeddings with the text embeddings. The latter enhances visual details for image editing## thereby preserving semantic consistency between the edited result and the source image. By combining the VLM enhanced with fine-grained region tokens and the time-dependent diffusion model## FireEdit demonstrates significant advantages in comprehending editing instructions and maintaining high semantic consistency.

34494,,,Flexible Group Count Enables Hassle-Free Structured Pruning,Densely structured pruning methods -- which generate pruned models in a fully dense format## allowing immediate compression benefits without additional demands -- are evolving owing to their practical significance. Traditional techniques in this domain mainly revolve around coarser granularities## such as filter pruning## thereby limiting their performance due to restricted pruning freedom.Recent advancements in Grouped Kernel Pruning (GKP) have enabled the utilization of finer granularity while maintaining the densely structured format.

32430,,2412.15213,Flowing from Words to Pixels: A Noise-Free Framework for Cross-Modality Evolution,Diffusion models## and their generalization## flow matching## have had a remarkable impact on the field of media generation. Here## the conventional approach is to learn the complex mapping from a simple source distribution of Gaussian noise to the target media distribution. For cross-modal tasks such as text-to-image generation## this same mapping from noise to image is learnt whilst including a conditioning mechanism in the model. One key and thus far relatively unexplored feature of flow matching is that## unlike Diffusion models## they are not constrained for the source distribution to be noise. Hence## in this paper## we propose a paradigm shift## and ask the question of whether we can instead train flow matching models to learn a direct mapping from the distribution of one modality to the distribution of another## thus obviating the need for both the noise distribution and conditioning mechanism. We present a general and simple framework## CrossFlow## for cross-modal flow matching. We show the importance of applying Variational Encoders to the input data## and introduce a method to enable Classifier-free guidance. Surprisingly## for text-to-image## CrossFlow with a vanilla transformer without cross attention slightly outperforms standard flow matching## and we show that it scales better with training steps and model size## while also allowing for interesting latent arithmetic which results in semantically meaningful edits in the output space. To demonstrate the generalizability of our approach## we also show that CrossFlow is on par with or outperforms the state-of-the-art for various cross-modal / intra-modal mapping tasks## viz. image captioning## depth estimation## and image super-resolution.

32591,,,Focus-N-Fix: Region-Aware Fine-Tuning for Text-to-Image Generation,Text-to-image (T2I) generation has made significant advances in recent years## but challenges still remain in the generation of perceptual artifacts## misalignment with complex prompts## and safety. The prevailing approach to address these issues involves collecting human feedback on generated images## training reward models to estimate human feedback## and then fine-tuning T2I models based on the reward models to align them with human preferences. However## while existing reward fine-tuning methods can produce images with higher rewards## they may change model behavior in unexpected ways.

To address these challenges## we propose a novel Track-Focused Online Multi-Object Tracker (TrackTrack) with two key strategies: Track-Perspective-Based Association (TPA) and Track-Aware Initialization (TAI). The TPA strategy associates each track with the most suitable detection result by choosing the one with the minimum distance from all available detection results in a track-perspective manner. On the other hand## TAI precludes the generation of spurious tracks in the track-aware aspect by suppressing track initialization of detection results that heavily overlap with current active tracks and more confident detection results.

Previous studies leverage a two-stage design where the AV encoders are firstly aligned via contrastive learning## then the encoded video representations guide the audio generation process. We observe that both contrastive learning and global video guidance are effective in aligning overall AV semantics while limiting temporally rhythmic synchronization. In this work## we propose Foley-Flow to first align unimodal AV encoders via masked modeling training## where the masked audio segments are recovered under the guidance of the corresponding video segments. After training## the AV encoders which are separately pretrained using only unimodal data are aligned with semantic and rhythmic consistency. Then## we develop a dynamic conditional flow for the final audio generation. Built upon the efficient velocity flow generation framework## our dynamic conditional flow utilizes temporally varying video features as the dynamic condition to guide corresponding audio segment generations. To this end## we extract coherent semantic and rhythmic representations during masked AV alignment## and use this representation of video segments to guide audio generation temporally.

34801,,,Free on the Fly: Enhancing Flexibility in Test-Time Adaptation with Online EM,Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have become prominent in open-world image recognition for their strong generalization abilities. Yet## their effectiveness in practical applications is compromised by domain shifts and distributional changes## especially when test data distributions diverge from training data. Therefore## the paradigm of test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged## enabling the use of online off-the-shelf data at test time## supporting independent sample predictions## and eliminating reliance on test annotations. Traditional TTA methods## however## often rely on costly training or optimization processes## or make unrealistic assumptions about accessing or storing historical training and test data.Instead## this study proposes FreeTTA## a training-free and universally available method that makes no assumptions## to enhance the flexibility of TTA. More importantly## FreeTTA is the first to explicitly model the test data distribution## enabling the use of intrinsic relationships among test samples to enhance predictions of individual samples without simultaneous access--a direction not previously explored. FreeTTA achieves these advantages by introducing an online EM algorithm that utilizes zero-shot predictions from VLMs as priors to iteratively compute the posterior probabilities of each online test sample and update parameters. Experiments demonstrate that FreeTTA achieves stable and significant improvements compared to state-of-the-art methods across 15 datasets in both cross-domain and out-of-distribution settings.,0,0

34660,,2411.12089,FruitNinja: 3D Object Interior Texture Generation with Gaussian Splatting,In the real world## objects reveal internal textures when sliced or cut## yet this behavior is not well-studied in 3D generation tasks today. For example## slicing a virtual 3D watermelon should reveal flesh and seeds. Given that no available dataset captures an object's full internal structure and collecting data from all slices is impractical## generative methods become the obvious approach. However## current 3D generation and inpainting methods often focus on visible appearance and overlook internal textures. To bridge this gap## we introduce FruitNinja## the first method to generate internal textures for 3D objects undergoing geometric and topological changes. Our approach produces objects via 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) with both surface and interior textures synthesized## enabling real-time slicing and rendering without additional optimization. FruitNinja leverages a pre-trained diffusion model to progressively inpaint cross-sectional views and applies voxel-grid-based smoothing to achieve cohesive textures throughout the object. Our OpaqueAtom GS strategy overcomes 3DGS limitations by employing densely distributed opaque Gaussians## avoiding biases toward larger particles that destabilize training and  sharp color transitions for fine-grained textures. Experimental results show that FruitNinja substantially outperforms existing approaches## showcasing unmatched visual quality in real-time rendered internal views across arbitrary geometry manipulations.

Functionality understanding is highly challenging## as it requires both world knowledge to interpret language and spatial perception to identify fine-grained objects. For example## given a task like 'turn on the ceiling light'## an embodied AI agent must infer that it needs to locate the light switch## even though the switch is not explicitly mentioned in the task description.To date## no dedicated methods have been developed for this problem. In this paper## we introduce Fun3DU## the first approach designed for functionality understanding in 3D scenes. Fun3DU uses a language model to parse the task description through Chain-of-Thought reasoning in order to identify the object of interest. The identified object is segmented across multiple views of the captured scene by using a VLM. The segmentation results from each view are lifted in 3D and aggregated into the point cloud using geometric information. Fun3DU is training-free## relying entirely on pre-trained models.

34643,,,Fuzzy Multimodal Learning for Trusted Cross-modal Retrieval,Cross-modal retrieval aims to match related samples across distinct modalities## facilitating the retrieval and discovery of heterogeneous information. Although existing methods show promising performance## most are deterministic models and are unable to capture the uncertainty inherent in the retrieval outputs## leading to potentially unreliable results. To address this issue## we propose a novel framework called FUzzy Multimodal lEarning (FUME)## which is able to self-estimate epistemic uncertainty## thereby embracing trusted cross-modal retrieval. Specifically## our FUME leverages the Fuzzy Set Theory to view the outputs of the classification network as a set of membership degrees and quantify category credibility by incorporating both possibility and necessity measures. However## directly optimizing the category credibility could mislead the model by over-optimizing the necessity for unmatched categories. To overcome this challenge## we present a novel fuzzy multimodal learning strategy## which utilizes label information to guide necessity optimization in the right direction## thereby indirectly optimizing category credibility and achieving accurate decision uncertainty quantification. Furthermore## we design an uncertainty merging scheme that accounts for decision uncertainties## thus further refining uncertainty estimates and boosting the trustworthiness of retrieval results. Extensive experiments on five benchmark datasets demonstrate that FUME remarkably improves both retrieval performance and reliability## offering a prospective solution for cross-modal retrieval in high-stakes applications.

Our method represents subject and scene using 3D poses and object positions## treating them as 3D context to learn spatial relationships in 3D space. Inspired by human vision## we align this context in an egocentric space## significantly reducing spatial complexity. Furthermore## we propose D^3 (direction-distance-decomposed) positional encoding to better capture the spatial relationship between 3D context and gaze direction in direction and distance space.

One of the most popular applications of Gaussian Splatting is to create animatable avatars## known as Gaussian Avatars. Recent works have pushed the boundaries of quality and rendering efficiency but suffer from two main limitations. Either they require expensive multi-camera rigs to produce avatars with free-view rendering## or they can be trained with a single camera but only rendered at high quality from this fixed viewpoint. An ideal model would be trained using a short monocular video or image from available hardware## such as a webcam## and rendered from any view.

Many tracking-by-detection approaches establish constrained relationships between detections and tracks using a distance threshold to reduce confusion during association. However## this approach does not effectively and comprehensively utilize the information regarding objects due to the constraints of the distance threshold. In this paper## we propose GRAE-3DMOT## Geometry Relation-Aware Encoder 3D Multi-Object Tracking## which contains a geometric relation-aware encoder to produce informative features for association.

The spatial relation-aware encoder effectively aggregates detection features by comprehensively exploiting as many detections as possible. The spatiotemporal relation-aware encoder provides spatiotemporal relation-aware features by combing spatial and temporal relation features## where the spatiotemporal relation-aware features are transformed into association scores for MOT. The distance-aware feature fusion layer is integrated into both encoders to enhance the relation features of physically proximate objects.

32632,,,Generalizing Deepfake Video Detection with Plug-and-Play: Video-Level Blending and Spatiotemporal Adapter Tuning,Three key challenges hinder the development of current deepfake video detection: (1) Temporal features can be complex and diverse: how can we identify general temporal artifacts to enhance model generalization? (2) Spatiotemporal models often lean heavily on one type of artifact and ignore the other: how can we ensure balanced learning from both? (3) Videos are naturally resource-intensive: how can we tackle efficiency without compromising accuracy? This paper attempts to tackle the three challenges jointly. First## inspired by the notable generality of using image-level blending data for image forgery detection## we investigate whether and how video-level blending can be effective in video. We then perform a thorough analysis and identify a previously underexplored temporal forgery artifact: Facial Feature Drift (FFD)## which commonly exists across different forgeries. To reproduce FFD## we then propose a novel Video-level Blending data (VB)## where VB is implemented by blending the original image and its warped version frame-by-frame## serving as a hard negative sample to mine more general artifacts. Second## we carefully design a lightweight Spatiotemporal Adapter (StA) to equip a pre-trained image model with the ability to capture both spatial and temporal features jointly and efficiently. StA is designed with two-stream 3D-Conv with varying kernel sizes## allowing it to process spatial and temporal features separately.

This is particularly challenging for more specular objects whose appearance strongly depends on the viewing direction. Some prior approaches model appearance variation across images using a per-image embedding vector## while others use physically-based rendering to recover the materials and per-image illumination.

However## if one asks the generator to synthesize a specific camera setting such as creating different fields of view using a 24mm lens versus a 70mm lens## the generator will not be able to interpret and generate scene-consistent images.

However## artifacts are often observed in the estimated depth map## e.g.## depth values for points located in the same region may jump dramatically. To address this issue## we propose a novel self-supervised monocular depth estimation framework called GeoDepth## where we explore the intrinsic geometric representation in 3D scenes for producing accurate and continuous depth maps. In particular## we model the complex 3D scene as a collection of planes with varying sizes## where each plane is characterized by a unique set of parameters## namely planar normal (indicating plane orientation) and planar offset (defining the perpendicular distance from the camera center to the plane). Under this modeling## points in the same plane are enforced to share a unique representation and their depth variations related only to pixel coordinates## thus this geometric relationship can be exploited to regularize the depth variations of these points. To this end## we design a structured plane generation module that introduces spatio-temporal geometric cues and the plane uniqueness principle to recover the correct scene plane representation. In addition## we develop a depth discontinuity module to identify depth discontinuity regions and subsequently optimize them. Our experiments on the KITTI and NYUv2 datasets demonstrate that GeoDepth achieves state-of-the-art performance## with additional tests on Make3D and ScanNet validating its generalization capabilities.,0,0

The graph generative modeling network then effectively models internal structures and spatial relationships within the constructed graphs## aiming to generate future graphs. The generated graphs serve as conditions for the control policy## mapping to robot actions. Our concise approach captures important spatial relations and enhances future graph generation accuracy## enabling the acquisition of robust policies from limited action-labeled data. Furthermore## the transferable graph representations facilitate the effective learning of manipulation skills from cross-embodiment videos. Our experiments exhibit that GraphMimic achieves superior performance using merely 20% action-labeled data. Moreover## our method outperforms the state-of-the-art method by over 17% and 23% in simulation and real-world experiments## and delivers improvements of over 33% in cross-embodiment transfer experiments.,0,0
34431,,,Gromov-Wasserstein Problem with Cyclic Symmetry,We propose novel fast algorithms for the Gromov--Wasserstein problem (GW) with cyclic symmetry of input data. This problem naturally appears as an object-matching task## which underlies various real-world computer vision applications## e.g.## image registration## point cloud registration## stereo matching## and 3D reconstruction.

33768,,2503.14832,H2ST: Hierarchical Two-Sample Tests for Continual Out-of-Distribution Detection,Task Incremental Learning (TIL) is a specialized form of Continual Learning (CL) in which a model incrementally learns from non-stationary data streams. Existing TIL methodologies operate under the closed-world assumption## presuming that incoming data remains in-distribution (ID). However## in an open-world setting## incoming samples may originate from out-of-distribution (OOD) sources## with their task identities inherently unknown.

33598,,2412.03748,HIIF: Hierarchical Encoding based Implicit Image Function for Continuous Super-resolution,Recent advances in implicit neural representations (INRs) have shown significant promise in modeling visual signals for various low-vision tasks including image super-resolution (ISR). INR-based ISR methods typically learn continuous representations## providing flexibility for generating high-resolution images at any desired scale from their low-resolution counterparts.

34513,,,HMAR: Efficient Hierarchical Masked Auto-Regressive Image Generation,Visual AutoRegressive modeling (VAR) shows promise in bridging the speed and quality gap between autoregressive image models and diffusion models. VAR reformulates autoregressive modeling by decomposing an image into successive resolution scales. During inference## an image is generated by predicting all the tokens in the next (higher-resolution) scale## conditioned on all tokens in all previous (lower-resolutions) scales. However## this formulation suffers from reduced image quality due to parallel generation of all tokens in a resolution scale; has sequence lengths scaling superlinearly in image resolution; and requires retraining to change the resolution sampling schedule.We introduce \underline H ierarchical \underline M asked \underline A uto\underline R egressive modeling (HMAR)## a new image generation algorithm that alleviates these issues using next-scale prediction and masked prediction to generate high-quality images with fast sampling. HMAR reformulates next-scale prediction as a Markovian process## wherein prediction of each resolution scale is conditioned only on tokens in its immediate predecessor instead of the tokens in all predecessor resolutions. When predicting a resolution scale## HMAR uses a controllable multi-step masked generation procedure to generate a subset of the tokens in each step. On ImageNet 256  x  256 and 512  x  512 benchmarks## HMAR models match or outperform parameter-matched VAR## diffusion## and autoregressive baselines. We develop efficient IO-aware block-sparse attention kernels that allow HMAR to achieve faster training and inference times over VAR by over 2.5xand 1.75 xrespectively## as well as over 3 xlower inference memory footprint. Finally## the Markovian formulation of HMAR yields additional flexibility over VAR; we show that its sampling schedule can be changed without further training## and it can be applied to image editing tasks in a zero-shot manner.,0,0

To address this issue## we introduce HOIGen-1M## the first large-scale dataset for HOI Generation## consisting of over one million high-quality videos collected from diverse sources. In particular## to guarantee the high quality of videos## we first design an efficient framework to automatically curate HOI videos using the powerful multimodal large language models (MLLMs)## and then the videos are further cleaned by human annotators. Moreover## to obtain accurate textual captions for HOI videos## we design a novel video description method based on a Mixture-of-Multimodal-Experts (MoME) strategy that not only generates expressive captions but also eliminates the hallucination by individual MLLM. Furthermore## due to the lack of an evaluation framework for generated HOI videos## we propose two new metrics to assess the quality of generated videos in a coarse-to-fine manner. Extensive experiments reveal that current T2V models struggle to generate high-quality HOI videos and confirm that our HOIGen-1M dataset is instrumental for improving HOI video generation.,0,0

We further look into the error types and find the mis-classification between no-interaction and with-interaction ones can be handled by human-object relation priors. Specifically## to better distinguish no-interaction from direct interactions## we propose 3D location prior## which indicates the distance between human and object; as of no-interaction vs. indirect interactions## we propose gaze area prior## which denotes whether human can see the object or not. The above two types of human-object relation priors are represented by text and are combined with the original visual features## generating multi-modal cues for interaction recognition.Experimental results on the HICO-DET and V-COCO datasets demonstrate that our proposed human-object relation priors are effective and our method HORP surpasses previous methods under various settings and scenarios.

35019,,2502.04369,HSI: A Holistic Style Injector for Arbitrary Style Transfer,Attention-based arbitrary style transfer methods have gained significant attention recently due to their impressive ability to synthesize style details. However## the point-wise matching within the attention mechanism may overly focus on local patterns such that neglect the remarkable global features of style images. Additionally## when processing large images## the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism will bring high computational load. To alleviate above problems## we propose Holistic Style Injector (HSI)## a novel attention-style transformation module to deliver artistic expression of target style. Specifically## HSI performs stylization only based on global style representation that is more in line with the characteristics of style transfer## to avoid generating local disharmonious patterns in stylized images. Moreover## we propose a dual relation learning mechanism inside the HSI to dynamically render images by leveraging semantic similarity in content and style## ensuring the stylized images preserve the original content and improve style fidelity. Note that the proposed HSI achieves linear computational complexity because it establishes feature mapping through element-wise multiplication rather than matrix multiplication.

35043,,2502.19894,High-Fidelity Relightable Monocular Portrait Animation with Lighting-Controllable Video Diffusion Model,Relightable portrait animation aims to animate a static reference portrait to match the head movements of a driving video while adapting to user-specified or reference lighting conditions. Existing portrait animation methods fail to achieve relightable portraits because they do not separate and manipulate intrinsic (identity and appearance) and extrinsic (pose and lighting) features. In this paper## we present a Lighting Controllable Video Diffusion model (LCVD) for high-fidelity## relightable portrait animation. We address this limitation by distinguishing these feature types through dedicated subspaces within the feature space of a pre-trained image-to-video diffusion model. Specifically## for each frame## we use the 3D mesh of the reference portrait## the pose of the driving frame as well as the specified lighting to render an image called shading hint. While the reference image represents the intrinsic attributes## the shading hint encodes the extrinsic attributes. In the training phase## we employ a reference adapter to map the reference into an intrinsic feature subspace and a shading adapter to map the shading hints into an extrinsic feature subspace. By merging features from these subspaces## the model achieves nuanced control over lighting and pose in generated animations. Extensive evaluations show that LCVD outperforms state-of-the-art methods in lighting realism## image quality## and video consistency## setting a new benchmark in relightable portrait animation.

33172,,2504.01512,High-fidelity 3D Object Generation from Single Image with RGBN-Volume Gaussian Reconstruction Model,Recently single-view 3D generation via Gaussian splatting has emerged and developed quickly. They learn 3D Gaussians from 2D RGB images generated from pre-trained multi-view diffusion (MVD) models## and have shown a promising avenue for 3D generation through a single image. Despite the current progress## these methods still suffer from the inconsistency jointly caused by the geometric ambiguity in the 2D images## and the lack of structure of 3D Gaussians## leading to distorted and blurry 3D object generation.

33072,,,High-quality Point Cloud Oriented Normal Estimation via Hybrid Angular and Euclidean Distance Encoding,The proliferation of Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology has facilitated the acquisition of three-dimensional point clouds## which are integral to applications in VR## AR## and Digital Twin. Oriented normals## critical for 3D reconstruction and scene analysis## cannot be directly extracted from scenes using LiDAR due to its operational principles.

To effectively utilize these priors for generation## we employ a video diffusion model that inherently prioritizes semantic information within the priors over pixel-level details. A content-adaptive control mechanism is proposed to scale and inject the priors into intermediate video latents during iterative denoising. In contrast to existing transformer-based networks that often suffer from artifacts within priors## leading to error accumulation and unrealistic results## our denoising diffusion network can smooth out artifacts and ensure natural outputs.

The main challenge to controllable video generation is to synthesize videos based on user-specified instance spatial locations and movement trajectories. However## existing methods suffer from a dilemma between the resource consumption## generation quality## and user controllability. As an efficient alternative to prohibitive training-based video generation## existing zero-shot video generation methods cannot generate high-quality and motion-consistent videos under the control of layouts and movement trajectories.

Extensive experiments demonstrate that IM-Zero outperforms existing methods in terms of video quality## inter-frame consistency## and the alignment of location and trajectory. Furthermore## compared with existing methods## IM-Zero enjoys extra advantages of versatility in video generation## including motion control of subparts within instances## finer control of specifying instance shapes via masks## and more difficult tasks of motion transfer for customizing fine-grained motion patterns through reference videos and high-quality text-to-video generation.,0,0

The IVTON task involves seamlessly superimposing a garment from one image onto a person in another## creating a realistic depiction of the person wearing the specified garment. Unlike conventional diffusion-based virtual try-on models that depend on large pre-trained U-Net architectures## ITA-MDT leverages a lightweight## scalable transformer-based denoising diffusion model with a mask latent modeling scheme## achieving competitive results while reducing computational overhead. A key component of ITA-MDT is the Image-Timestep Adaptive Feature Aggregator (ITAFA)## a dynamic feature aggregator that combines all of the features from the image encoder into a unified feature of the same size## guided by diffusion timestep and garment image complexity. This enables adaptive weighting of features## allowing the model to emphasize either global information or fine-grained details based on the requirements of the denoising stage. Additionally## the Salient Region Extractor (SRE) module is presented to identify complex region of the garment to provide high-resolution local information to the denoising model as an additional condition alongside the global information of the full garment image. This targeted conditioning strategy enhances detail preservation of fine details in highly salient garment regions## optimizing computational resources by avoiding unnecessarily processing entire garment image. Comparative evaluations confirms that ITA-MDT improves efficiency while maintaining strong performance## reaching state-of-the-art results in several metrics.,0,0

33136,,,Identity-Clothing Similarity Modeling for Unsupervised Clothing Change Person Re-Identification,Clothing change person re-identification (CC-ReID) aims to match different images of the same person## even when the clothing varies across images.

33557,,2411.16171,Image Generation Diversity Issues and How to Tame Them,Generative methods have reached a level of quality that is almost indistinguishable from real data. However## while individual samples may appear unique## generative models often exhibit limitations in covering the full data distribution. Unlike quality issues## diversity problems within generative models are not easily detected by simply observing single images or generated datasets## which means we need a specific measure to assess the diversity of these models. In this paper## we draw attention to the current lack of diversity in generative models and the inability of common metrics to measure this.  We achieve this by framing diversity as an image retrieval problem## where we measure how many real images can be retrieved using synthetic data as queries. This yields the Image Retrieval Score (IRS)## an interpretable## hyperparameter-free metric that quantifies the diversity of a generative model's output. IRS requires only a subset of synthetic samples and provides a statistical measure of confidence. Our experiments indicate that current feature extractors commonly used in generative model assessment are inadequate for evaluating diversity effectively. Consequently## we perform an extensive search for the best feature extractors to assess diversity. Evaluation reveals that current diffusion models converge to limited subsets of the real distribution## with no current state-of-the-art models superpassing 77% of the diversity of the training data. To address this limitation## we introduce Diversity-Aware Diffusion Models (DiADM)## a novel approach that improves diversity of unconditional diffusion models without loss of image quality.

Despite continuous advancements in formula recognition models## the evaluation metrics employed by these models## such as BLEU and Edit Distance## still exhibit notable limitations. They overlook the fact that the same formula has diverse representations and is highly sensitive to the distribution of training data## thereby causing unfairness in formula recognition evaluation. To this end## we propose a Character Detection Matching (CDM) metric## ensuring the evaluation objectivity by designing an image-level rather than a LaTeX-level metric score. Specifically## CDM renders both the model-predicted LaTeX and the ground-truth LaTeX formulas into image-formatted formulas## then employs visual feature extraction and localization techniques for precise character-level matching## incorporating spatial position information. Such a spatially-aware and character-matching method offers a more accurate and equitable evaluation compared with previous BLEU and Edit Distance metrics that rely solely on text-based character matching. Experimentally## we evaluated various formula recognition models using CDM## BLEU## and ExpRate metrics.

However## biased T2I models can generate content with specific tendencies## potentially influencing people's perceptions. Intentional exploitation of these biases risks conveying misleading information to the public. Current research on bias primarily addresses explicit biases with recognizable visual patterns## such as skin color and gender.

This subtle and versatile nature makes this bias challenging to detect## easy to propagate## and adaptable to a wide range of scenarios. We further propose an implicit bias injection attack framework (IBI-Attacks) against T2I diffusion models by precomputing a general bias direction in the prompt embedding space and adaptively adjusting it based on different inputs. Our attack module can be seamlessly integrated into pre-trained diffusion models in a plug-and-play manner without direct manipulation of user input or model retraining. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our scheme in introducing bias through subtle and diverse modifications while preserving the original semantics.The strong concealment and transferability of our attack across various scenarios further underscore the significance of our approach.,0,0

33100,,2503.00876,Improve Representation for Imbalanced Regression through Geometric Constraints,In representation learning## uniformity refers to the uniform feature distribution in the latent space (i.e.## unit hypersphere). Previous work has shown that improving uniformity contributes to the learning of under-represented classes. However## most of the previous work focused on classification; the representation space of imbalanced regression remains unexplored. Classification-based methods are not suitable for regression tasks because they cluster features into distinct groups without considering the continuous and ordered nature essential for regression. In a geometric aspect## we uniquely focus on ensuring uniformity in the latent space for imbalanced regression through two key losses: enveloping and homogeneity. The enveloping loss encourages the induced trace to uniformly occupy the surface of a hypersphere## while the homogeneity loss ensures smoothness## with representations evenly spaced at consistent intervals. Our method integrates these geometric principles into the data representations via a Surrogate-driven Representation Learning (SRL) framework.

While most existing video VAEs inflate a pre-trained image VAE into the 3D causal structure for temporal-spatial compression## this paper presents two astonishing findings: (1) The initialization from a well-trained image VAE with the same latent dimensions is not an optimal scheme. (2) The adoption of causal reasoning leads to unequal information interactions and unbalanced performance between frames. To alleviate these problems## we propose a keyframe-based temporal compression (KTC) architecture and a group causal convolution (GCConv) module to further improve video VAE (IV-VAE). Specifically## the KTC architecture divides the latent space into two branches## in which one half completely inherits the compression prior of keyframes from a lower-dimension image VAE while the other half involves temporal compression through 3D group causal convolution## reducing temporal-spatial conflicts and accelerating the convergence speed of video VAE. The GCConv in the above 3D half uses standard convolution within each frame group to ensure inter-frame equivalence## and employs causal logical padding between groups to maintain flexibility in processing variable frame video.

A typical approach to improving adversarial transferability is by refining the surrogate model. However## existing work on ViTs has restricted their surrogate refinement to backward propagation. In this work## we instead focus on Forward Propagation Refinement (FPR) and specifically refine two key modules of ViTs: attention maps and token embeddings. For attention maps## we propose Attention Map Diversification (AMD)## which diversifies certain attention maps and also implicitly imposes beneficial gradient vanishing during backward propagation. For token embeddings## we propose Momentum Token Embedding (MTE)## which accumulates historical token embeddings to stabilize the forward updates in both the Attention and MLP blocks.

These limitations significantly hinder complex editing scenarios where multiple objects need to be modified while preserving their contextual relationships. We address this fundamental challenge through two key proposals: enabling rough mask inputs that preserve existing content while naturally integrating new elements and supporting consistent editing across multiple modifications. Our framework achieves this through layer-wise memory## which stores latent representations and prompt embeddings from previous edits. We propose Background Consistency Guidance that leverages memorized latents to maintain scene coherence and Multi-Query Disentanglement in cross-attention that ensures natural adaptation to existing content. To evaluate our method## we present a new benchmark dataset incorporating semantic alignment metrics and interactive editing scenarios.

Focusing on sample quality during training## in this paper## we are the first to incorporate discriminator rejection sampling (DRS) into the training process and introduce a novel method## called quality aware dynamic discriminator rejection sampling (QADDRS). Specifically## QADDRS consists of two steps: (1) the sample quality aware step## which aims to obtain the sorted critic scores## i.e.## the ordered discriminator outputs## on real/fake samples in the current training stage; (2) the dynamic rejection step that obtains dynamic rejection number N## where N is controlled by the overfitting degree of discriminator (D) during training. When updating the parameters of D## the N high critic score real samples and the N low critic score fake samples in the minibatch are rejected dynamically based on the overfitting degree of D. As a result## QADDRS can avoid D becoming overly confident in distinguishing both real and fake samples## thereby alleviating the overfitting of D issue during training.

In this paper## we propose a new 3DGS-based method 'IndoorGS'## that leverages the commonly found yet important geometric cues in indoor scenes to improve the reconstruction quality. Specifically## we first extract 2D lines from input images and fuse them into 3D line cues via feature-based matching## which can provide a structural understanding of the target scene. We then apply the statistical outlier removal to refine Structure-from-Motion (SfM) points## ensuring robust cues in texture-rich areas. Based on these two types of cues## we further extract reliable 3D plane cues for textureless regions. Such geometric information will be utilized not only for initialization but also in the realization of a geometric-cue-guided adaptive density control (ADC) strategy. The proposed ADC approach is grounded in the principle of divide-and-conquer and optimizes the use of each type of geometric cues to enhance overall reconstruction performance. Extensive experiments on multiple indoor datasets show that our method can deliver much more accurate geometry and higher rendering quality for indoor scenes than existing 3DGS approaches.,0,0

33457,,2409.19601,Infighting in the Dark: Multi-Label Backdoor Attack in Federated Learning,Federated Learning (FL)## a privacy-preserving decentralized machine learning framework## has been shown to be vulnerable to backdoor attacks. Current research primarily focuses on the Single-Label Backdoor Attack (SBA)## wherein adversaries share a consistent target. However## a critical fact is overlooked: adversaries may be non-cooperative## have distinct targets## and operate independently## which exhibits a more practical scenario called Multi-Label Backdoor Attack (MBA). Unfortunately## prior works are ineffective in the MBA scenario since non-cooperative attackers exclude each other.

To address this limitation## we propose Mirage## the first non-cooperative MBA strategy in FL that allows attackers to inject effective and persistent backdoors into the global model without collusion by constructing in-distribution (ID) backdoor mapping. Specifically## we introduce an adversarial adaptation method to bridge the backdoor features and the target distribution in an ID manner. Additionally## we further leverage a constrained optimization method to ensure the ID mapping survives in the global training dynamics. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that Mirage outperforms various state-of-the-art attacks and bypasses existing defenses## achieving an average ASR greater than 97% and maintaining over 90% after 900 rounds.

Additionally## our methods generalize across modern generative model families including generative adversarial networks and diffusion models. We demonstrate the superior interpretability and steerability of our methods on numerous standard datasets like CelebA## CelebA-HQ## and CUB with large improvements (average  25%) over the prior work## while being 4-15x faster to train.

33410,,2503.10247,Interpretable Image Classification via Non-parametric Part Prototype Learning,Classifying images with an interpretable decision-making process is a long-standing problem in computer vision. In recent years## Prototypical Part Networks has gained traction as an approach for self-explainable neural networks## due to their ability to mimic human visual reasoning by providing explanations based on prototypical object parts. However## the quality of the explanations generated by these methods leaves room for improvement## as the prototypes usually focus on repetitive and redundant concepts. Leveraging recent advances in prototype learning## we present a framework for part-based interpretable image classification that learns a set of semantically distinctive object parts for each class## and provides diverse and comprehensive explanations. The core of our method is to learn the part-prototypes in a non-parametric fashion## through clustering deep features extracted from foundation vision models that encode robust semantic information. To quantitatively evaluate the quality of explanations provided by ProtoPNets## we introduce Distinctiveness Score and Comprehensiveness Score. Through evaluation on CUB-200-2011## Stanford Cars and Stanford Dogs datasets## we show that our framework compares favourably against existing ProtoPNets while achieving better interpretability.,0,0
34644,,2411.16198,Interpreting Object-level Foundation Models via Visual Precision Search,Advances in multimodal pre-training have propelled object-level foundation models## such as Grounding DINO and Florence-2## in tasks like visual grounding and object detection. However## interpreting these models' decisions has grown increasingly challenging. Existing interpretable attribution methods for object-level task interpretation have notable limitations: (1) gradient-based methods lack precise localization due to visual-textual fusion in foundation models## and (2) perturbation-based methods produce noisy saliency maps## limiting fine-grained interpretability. To address these## we propose a Visual Precision Search method that generates accurate attribution maps with fewer regions. Our method bypasses internal model parameters to overcome attribution issues from multimodal fusion## dividing inputs into sparse sub-regions and using consistency and collaboration scores to accurately identify critical decision-making regions. We also conducted a theoretical analysis of the boundary guarantees and scope of applicability of our method. Experiments on RefCOCO## MS COCO## and LVIS show our approach enhances object-level task interpretability over SOTA for Grounding DINO and Florence-2 across various evaluation metrics## with faithfulness gains of 23.7%## 31.6%## and 20.1% on MS COCO## LVIS## and RefCOCO for Grounding DINO## and 50.7% and 66.9% on MS COCO and RefCOCO for Florence-2.

With the powerful image generation ability## diffusion-based DA has shown strong performance gains on different image classification benchmarks. In this paper## we analyze today's diffusion-based DA methods## and argue that they cannot take account of both faithfulness and diversity## which are two critical keys for generating high-quality samples and boosting classification performance. To this end## we propose a novel Diffusion-based DA method: Diff-II. Specifically## it consists of three steps: 1) Category concepts learning: Learning concept embeddings for each category. 2) Inversion interpolation: Calculating the inversion for each image## and conducting circle interpolation for two randomly sampled inversions from the same category. 3) Two-stage denoising: Using different prompts to generate synthesized images in a coarse-to-fine manner.

32954,,,Investigating the Role of Weight Decay in Enhancing Nonconvex SGD,Weight decay is a widely used technique in training machine learning models## known to empirically enhance the generalization of Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD). While intuitively weight decay allows SGD to train a regularized model rather than the original one## there is limited theoretical understanding of why SGD with weight decay (SGDW) yields results consistent with the unregularized model## or how weight decay improves generalization. This paper establishes a convergence theory for SGDW in the context of the unregularized model## under weaker assumptions than previous analyses of weight decay. Our theory demonstrates that weight decay does not accelerate the convergence of SGD. For generalization## we provide the first theoretical proof of weight decay's benefit in nonconvex optimization. Additionally## we extend our results to sign-based stochastic gradient algorithms## such as SignSGD. Numerical experiments on classical benchmarks validate our theoretical findings.,0,0

Existing backdoor attacks that are effective in SSL often involve noticeable triggers## like colored patches or visible noise## which are vulnerable to human inspection. This paper proposes an imperceptible and effective backdoor attack against self-supervised models. We first find that existing imperceptible triggers designed for supervised learning are less effective in compromising self-supervised models. We then identify this ineffectiveness is attributed to the overlap in distributions between the backdoor and augmented samples used in SSL. Building on this insight## we design an attack using optimized triggers disentangled with the augmented transformation in the SSL## while remaining imperceptible to human vision. Experiments on five datasets and six SSL algorithms demonstrate our attack is highly effective and stealthy. It also has strong resistance to existing backdoor defenses.

A Consecutive Events-Based Benchmark for Future Long Video Generation,The current state-of-the-art video generative models can produce commercial-grade videos with highly realistic details. However## they still struggle to coherently present multiple sequential events in specific short stories## which is foreseeable an essential capability for future long video generation scenarios. For example## top T2V generative models still fail to generate a video of the short simple story 'how to put an elephant into a refrigerator.' While existing detail-oriented benchmarks primarily focus on fine-grained metrics like aesthetic quality and spatial-temporal consistency## they fall short of evaluating models' abilities to handle event-level story presentation. To address this gap## we introduce StoryEval## a story-oriented benchmark specifically designed to assess text-to-video (T2V) models' story-completion capabilities. StoryEval features 423 prompts spanning 7 classes## each representing short stories composed of 2-4 consecutive events. We employ Vision-Language Models## such as GPT-4o and LLaVA-OV-Chat-72B## to verify the completion of each event in the generated videos## applying a unanimous voting method to enhance reliability. Our methods ensure high alignment with human evaluations## and the evaluation of 11 models reveals its challenge## with none exceeding an average story-completion rate of 50%. StoryEval provides a new benchmark for advancing T2V models and highlights the challenges and opportunities in developing next-generation solutions for coherent story-driven video generation.

Enhancing Object Orientation Understanding in Multimodal Large Language Models through Egocentric Instruction Tuning,Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) act as essential interfaces## connecting humans with AI technologies in multimodal applications. However## current MLLMs face challenges in accurately interpreting object orientation in images due to inconsistent orientation annotations in training data## hindering the development of a coherent orientation understanding. To overcome this## we propose egocentric instruction tuning## which aligns MLLMs' orientation understanding with the user's perspective## based on a consistent annotation standard derived from the user's egocentric viewpoint. We first generate egocentric instruction data that leverages MLLMs' ability to recognize object details and applies prior knowledge for orientation understanding. Using this data## we perform instruction tuning to enhance the model's capability for accurate orientation interpretation. In addition## we introduce EgoOrientBench## a benchmark that evaluates MLLMs' orientation understanding across three tasks using images collected from diverse domains. Experimental results on this benchmark show that egocentric instruction tuning significantly improves orientation understanding without compromising overall MLLM performance.

Fine-grained Detecting and Calibrating Abnormal Human-body,Recent improvements in visual synthesis have significantly enhanced the depiction of generated human photos## which are pivotal due to their wide applicability and demand. Nonetheless## the existing text-to-image or text-to-video models often generate low-quality human photos that might differ considerably from real-world body structures## referred to as 'abnormal human bodies'. Such abnormalities## typically deemed unacceptable## pose considerable challenges in the detection and repair of them within human photos.

Intuitively## Visual Language Models (VLMs) that have obtained remarkable performance on various visual tasks are quite suitable for this task. However## their performance on abnormality detection in human photos is quite poor.Hence## it is quite important to highlight this task for the research community. In this paper## we first introduce a simple yet challenging task## i.e.## Fine-grained Human-body Abnormality Detection (FHAD)## and construct two high-quality datasets for evaluation.

34642,,,It's a (Blind) Match! Towards Vision-Language Correspondence without Parallel Data,The platonic representation hypothesis suggests that vision and language embeddings become more homogeneous as model and dataset sizes increase. In particular## pairwise distances within each modality become more similar. This suggests that as foundation models mature## it may become possible to match vision and language embeddings in a fully unsupervised fashion## i.e. without parallel data. We present the first feasibility study## and investigate conformity of existing vision and language foundation models in the context of unsupervised## or 'blind'## matching. First## we formulate unsupervised matching as a quadratic assignment problem and introduce a novel heuristic that outperforms previous solvers. We also develop a technique to find optimal matching problems## for which a non-trivial match is very likely. Second## we conduct an extensive study deploying a range of vision and language models on four datasets. Our analysis reveals that for many problem instances## vision and language representations can be indeed matched without supervision. This finding opens up the exciting possibility of embedding semantic knowledge into other modalities virtually annotation-free.

34667,,2411.15231,IterIS: Iterative Inference-Solving Alignment for LoRA Merging,Low-rank adaptations (LoRA) are widely used to fine-tune large models across various domains for specific downstream tasks. While task-specific LoRAs are often available## concerns about data privacy and intellectual property can restrict access to training data## limiting the acquisition of a multi-task model through gradient-based training. In response## LoRA merging presents an effective solution by combining multiple LoRAs into a unified adapter while maintaining data privacy. Prior works on LoRA merging primarily frame it as an optimization problem## yet these approaches face several limitations## including the rough assumption about input features utilized in optimization## massive sample requirements## and the unbalanced optimization objective. These limitations can significantly degrade performance. To address these## we propose a novel optimization-based method## named IterIS: 1) We formulate LoRA merging as an advanced optimization problem to mitigate the rough assumption. Additionally## we employ an iterative inference-solving framework in our algorithm. It can progressively refine the optimization objective for improved performance. 2) We introduce an efficient regularization term to reduce the need for massive sample requirements (requiring only 1-5% of the unlabeled samples compared to prior methods). 3) We utilize adaptive weights in the optimization objective to mitigate potential unbalances in LoRA merging process. Our method demonstrates significant improvements over multiple baselines and state-of-the-art methods in composing tasks for text-to-image diffusion## vision-language models## and large language models. Furthermore## our layer-wise algorithm can achieve convergence with minimal steps## ensuring efficiency in both memory and computation.,0,0
32756,,2503.13147,Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding for Real-World Image Dehazing,We propose a novel Iterative Predictor-Critic Code Decoding framework for real-world image dehazing## abbreviated as IPC-Dehaze## which leverages the high-quality codebook prior encapsulated in a pre-trained VQGAN. Apart from previous codebook-based methods that rely on one-shot decoding## our method utilizes high-quality codes obtained in the previous iteration to guide the prediction of the Code-Predictor in the subsequent iteration## improving code prediction accuracy and ensuring stable dehazing performance. Our idea stems from the observations that 1) the degradation of hazy images varies with haze density and scene depth## and 2) clear regions play crucial cues in restoring dense haze regions. However## it is nontrivial to progressively refine the obtained codes in subsequent iterations## owing to the difficulty in determining which codes should be retained or replaced at each iteration. Another key insight of our study is to propose Code-Critic to capture interrelations among codes. The Code-Critic is used to evaluate code correlations and then resample a set of codes with the highest mask scores## i.e.## a higher score indicates that the code is more likely to be rejected## which helps retain more accurate codes and predict difficult ones. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of our method over state-of-the-art methods in real-world dehazing. Our code will be made publicly available.,0,0

35261,,2503.17198,Jailbreaking the Non-Transferable Barrier via Test-Time Data Disguising,Non-transferable learning (NTL) has been proposed to protect model intellectual property (IP) by creating a 'non-transferable barrier' to restrict generalization from authorized to unauthorized domains. Recently## well-designed attack## which restores the unauthorized-domain performance by fine-tuning NTL models on few authorized samples## highlights the security risks of NTL-based applications. However## such attack requires modifying model weights## thus being invalid in the black-box scenario. This raises a critical question: can we trust the security of NTL models deployed as black-box systems? In this work## we reveal the first loophole of black-box NTL models by proposing a novel attack method (dubbed as JailNTL) to jailbreak the non-transferable barrier through test-time data disguising## The main idea of JailNTL is to disguise unauthorized data so it can be identified as authorized by the NTL model## thereby bypassing the non-transferable barrier without modifying the NTL model weights. Specifically## JailNTL encourages unauthorized-domain disguising in two levels## including: (i) data-intrinsic disguising (DID) for eliminating domain discrepancy and preserving class-related content at the input-level## and (ii) model-guided disguising (MGD) for mitigating output-level statistics difference of the NTL model. Empirically## when attacking state-of-the-art (SOTA) NTL models in the black-box scenario## JailNTL achieves an accuracy increase of up to 55.7% in the unauthorized domain by using only 1% authorized samples## largely exceeding existing SOTA white-box attacks.

To mitigate this requirement## existing methods jointly optimize camera poses and NeRF often relying on good pose initialisation or depth priors. However## these approaches struggle in challenging scenarios## such as large rotations## as they map each camera to a world coordinate system. We propose a novel method that eliminates prior dependencies by modeling continuous camera motions as time-dependent angular velocity and velocity. Relative motions between cameras are learned first via velocity integration## while camera poses can be obtained by aggregating such relative motions up to a world coordinate system defined at a single time step within the video. Specifically## accurate continuous camera movements are learned through a time-dependent NeRF## which captures local scene geometry and motion by training from neighboring frames for each time step. The learned motions enable fine-tuning the NeRF to represent the full scene geometry. Experiments on Co3D and Scannet show our approach achieves superior camera pose and depth estimation and comparable novel-view synthesis performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.,0,0

A typical demonstration is that V-L models often produce biased predictions against specific groups of people## significantly undermining their real-world applicability. Existing approaches endeavor to mitigate the social bias problem in V-L models by removing biased attribute information from model embeddings. However## after our revisiting of these methods## we find that their bias removal is frequently accompanied by greatly compromised V-L alignment capabilities. We then reveal that this performance degradation stems from the unbalanced debiasing in image and text embeddings. To address this issue## we propose a novel V-L debiasing framework to align image and text biases followed by removing them from both modalities. By doing so## our method achieves multi-modal bias mitigation while maintaining the V-L alignment in the debiased embeddings. Additionally## we advocate a new evaluation protocol that can 1) holistically quantify the model debiasing and V-L alignment ability## and 2) evaluate the generalization of social bias removal models.

34207,,2503.10259,KVQ: Boosting Video Quality Assessment via Saliency-guided Local Perception,Video Quality Assessment (VQA)## which intends to predict the perceptual quality of videos## has attracted increasing attention. Due to factors like motion blur or specific distortions## the quality of different regions in a video varies. Recognizing the region-wise local quality within a video is beneficial for assessing global quality and can guide us in adopting fine-grained enhancement or transcoding strategies. Due to the heavy cost of annotating region-wise quality## the lack of ground truth constraints from relevant datasets further complicates the utilization of local perception. Inspired by the Human Visual System (HVS) that links global quality to the local texture of different regions and their visual saliency## we propose a Kaleidoscope Video Quality Assessment (KVQ) framework## which aims to effectively assess both saliency and local texture## thereby facilitating the assessment of global quality. Our framework extracts visual saliency and allocates attention using Fusion-Window Attention (FWA) while incorporating a Local Perception Constraint (LPC) to mitigate the reliance of regional texture perception on neighboring areas. KVQ obtains significant improvements across multiple scenarios on five VQA benchmarks compared to SOTA methods. Furthermore## to assess local perception## we establish a new Local Perception Visual Quality (LPVQ) dataset with region-wise annotations. Experimental results demonstrate the capability of KVQ in perceiving local distortions. KVQ models and the LPVQ dataset will be available at https://github.com/qyp2000/KVQ.,0,0
33076,,,Keep the Balance: A Parameter-Efficient Symmetrical Framework for RGB+X Semantic Segmentation,Multimodal semantic segmentation is a critical challenge in computer vision## with early methods suffering from high computational costs and limited transferability due to full fine-tuning of RGB-based pre-trained parameters. Recent studies## while leveraging additional modalities as supplementary prompts to RGB## still predominantly rely on RGB## which restricts the full potential of other modalities. To address these issues## we propose a novel symmetric parameter-efficient fine-tuning framework for multimodal segmentation## featuring with a modality-aware prompting and adaptation scheme## to simultaneously adapt the capabilities of a powerful pre-trained model to both RGB and X modalities.

32536,,,LAL: Enhancing 3D Human Motion Prediction with Latency-aware Auxiliary Learning,Making accurate prediction of human motions based on the historical observation is a crucial technology for robots to collaborate with humans. Existing human motion prediction methods are all built under an ideal assumption that robots can instantaneously react## which ignores the time delay introduced during data processing & analysis and future reaction planning -- jointly known as 'response latency'. Consequently## the predictions made within this latency period become meaningless for practical use## as part of the time has passed and the corresponding real motions have already occurred before robot deliver its reaction.

The framework consists of two branches handling different tasks: the primary branch learns to directly predict the valid target (excluding the beginning latency period) based on observation; while the auxiliary branch learns the same target## but based on the reformed observation with additional latency data incorporated. A direct and effective way of auxiliary feature sharing is forced by our tailored consistency loss## to gradually integrate auxiliary latency insights into the primary prediction branch. Estimated feature statistics-based alignment method is presented as optional step for primary branch refinement.

Yet## their complex computations pose challenges for practical deployments## particularly in real-time applications. To tackle this issue## researchers have explored various lightweight and efficient network designs. However## existing lightweight models predominantly leverage self-attention mechanisms and convolutions for token mixing.

35004,,2412.01292,LSceneLLM: Enhancing Large 3D Scene Understanding Using Adaptive Visual Preferences,Research on 3D Vision-Language Models (3D-VLMs) is gaining increasing attention## which is crucial for developing embodied AI within 3D scenes## such as visual navigation and embodied question answering. Due to the high density of visual features## especially in large 3D scenes## accurately locating task-relevant visual information is challenging. Existing works attempt to segment all objectsand consider their features as scene representations. However## these task-agnostic object features include much redundant information and missing details for the task-relevant area. To tackle these problems## we propose LSceneLLM## an adaptive framework that automatically identifies task-relevant areas by leveraging LLM's visual preference for different tasks## followed by a plug-and-play scene magnifier module to capture fine-grained details in focused areas. Specifically## a dense token selector examines the attention map of LLM to identify visual preferences for the instruction input. It then magnifies fine-grained details of the focusing area. An adaptive self-attention module is leveraged to fuse the coarse-grained and selected fine-grained visual information. To comprehensively evaluate the large scene understanding ability of 3D-VLMs## we further introduce a cross-room understanding benchmark## XR-Scene## which contains a series of large scene understanding tasks including XR-QA## XR-EmbodiedPlanning## and XR-SceneCaption. Experiments show that our method surpasses existing methods on both large scene understanding and existing scene understanding benchmarks. Plunging our scene magnifier module into the existing 3D-VLMs also brings significant improvement.,0,0

Scaling the number of concepts in customized generation meets a broader demand for user creation## whereas existing methods face challenges with generation quality and computational efficiency. In this paper## we propose LaTexBlend## a novel framework for effectively and efficiently scaling multi-concept customized generation. The core idea of LaTexBlend is to represent single concepts and blend multiple concepts within a Latent Textual space## which is positioned after the text encoder and a linear projection. LaTexBlend customizes each concept individually## storing them in a concept bank with a compact representation of latent textual features that captures sufficient concept information to ensure high fidelity. At inference## concepts from the bank can be freely and seamlessly combined in the latent textual space## offering two key merits for multi-concept generation: 1) excellent scalability## and 2) significant reduction of denoising deviation## preserving coherent layouts.

33298,,2503.23283,Language Guided Concept Bottleneck Models for Interpretable Continual Learning,Continual learning (CL) aims to enable learning systems to acquire new knowledge constantly without forgetting previously learned information. CL faces the challenge of mitigating catastrophic forgetting while maintaining interpretability across tasks.Most existing CL methods focus primarily on preserving learned knowledge to improve model performance. However## as new information is introduced## the interpretability of the learning process becomes crucial for understanding the evolving decision-making process## yet it is rarely explored. In this paper## we introduce a novel framework that integrates language-guided Concept Bottleneck Models (CBMs) to address both challenges. Our approach leverages the Concept Bottleneck Layer## aligning semantic consistency with CLIP models to learn human-understandable concepts that can generalize across tasks. By focusing on interpretable concepts## our method not only enhances the model's ability to retain knowledge over time but also provides transparent decision-making insights. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by achieving superior performance on several datasets## outperforming state-of-the-art methods with an improvement of up to 3.06% in final average accuracy on ImageNet-subset.

35128,,,Language-Assisted Debiasing and Smoothing for Foundation Model-Based Semi-Supervised Learning,Recent studies have focused on introducing pre-trained foundation models into semi-supervised learning (SSL) tasks. Nevertheless## these foundation models can exhibit biases toward different classes and tend to generate imbalanced pseudo-labels for SSL. Thus## efforts have been made to introduce the logit adjustment offset to reduce the inherent bias in foundation models for SSL tasks.Despite their success##  existing foundation model-based SSL methods face challenges: 1) unreliability in the estimated logit adjustment offset## 2) overlooking the potential of linguistic knowledge in capturing model biases and 3) fail to fully exploit the unlabeled samples. To address these issues## we propose   Language-Assisted Debiasing and Smoothing framework## namely LADaS## for foundation model-based SSL.   It consists of two components: 1) Language-assisted Pseudo-Label Debiasing (LPLD) to reduce biases in foundation models## and 2) Language-aware Pseudo-Label Smoothing (LPLS) to fully exploit  low-confidence samples to facilitate SSL training. In particular## LPLD introduces a reliability score to dynamically assess the  reliability of the logit adjustment. Additionally## it incorporates a language-oriented preference to reduce model biases using linguistic knowledge derived from pre-trained language models. Finally##  LPLS introduces  language-aware soft labels and devises language-aware pseudo-label smoothing loss to guide the learning of unlabeled samples with low-quality pseudo-labels.

However## there is no direct correlation between the diverse background music and movements in sporting events. Previous works require a large number of model parameters to learn potential associations between actions and music. To address this issue## we propose a language-guided audio-visual learning (MLAVL) framework that models 'audio-action-visual' correlations guided by low-cost language modality. In our framework## multidimensional domain-based actions form action knowledge graphs## motivating audio-visual modalities to focus on task-relevant actions. We further design a shared-specific context encoder to integrate deep multimodal semantics## and an audio-visual cross-modal fusion module to evaluate action-music consistency. To match the sport's rules## we then propose a dual-branch prompt-guided grading module to weigh both visual and audio-visual performance.

34961,,2412.05796,Language-Guided Image Tokenization for Generation,Image tokenization## the process of transforming raw image pixels into a compact low-dimensional latent representation## has proven crucial for scalable and efficient image generation. However## mainstream image tokenization methods generally have limited compression rates## making high-resolution image generation computationally expensive. To address this challenge## we propose to leverage language for efficient image tokenization## and we call our method Text-Conditioned Image Tokenization (TexTok). TexTok is a simple yet effective tokenization framework that leverages language to provide a compact## high-level semantic representation. By conditioning the tokenization process on descriptive text captions## TexTok simplifies semantic learning## allowing more learning capacity and token space to be allocated to capture fine-grained visual details## leading to enhanced reconstruction quality and higher compression rates. Compared to the conventional tokenizer without text conditioning## TexTok achieves average reconstruction FID improvements of 29.2% and 48.1% on ImageNet-256 and -512 benchmarks respectively## across varying numbers of tokens. These tokenization improvements consistently translate to 16.3% and 34.3% average improvements in generation FID. By simply replacing the tokenizer in Diffusion Transformer (DiT) with TexTok## our system can achieve a 93.5x inference speedup while still outperforming the original DiT using only 32 tokens on ImageNet-512. TexTok with a vanilla DiT generator achieves state-of-the-art FID scores of 1.46 and 1.62 on ImageNet-256 and -512 respectively. Furthermore## we demonstrate TexTok's superiority on the text-to-image generation task## effectively utilizing the off-the-shelf text captions in tokenization.,0,0
34388,,,Language-Guided Salient Object Ranking,Salient Object Ranking (SOR) aims to study human attention shifts across different objects in the scene. It is a challenging task## as it requires comprehension of the relations among the salient objects in the scene. However## existing works often overlook such relations or model them implicitly. In this work## we observe that when Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) describe a scene## they usually focus on the most salient object first## and then discuss the relations as they move on to the next (less salient) one. Based on this observation## we propose a novel Language-Guided Salient Object Ranking approach (named LG-SOR)## which utilizes the internal knowledge within the LVLM-generated language descriptions## i.e.## semantic relation cues and the implicit entity order cues## to facilitate saliency ranking. Specifically## we first propose a novel Text-Guided Visual Modulation (TGVM) module to incorporate semantic information in the description for saliency ranking. TGVM controls the flow of linguistic information to the visual features## suppresses noisy background image features## and enables propagation of useful textual features. We then propose a novel Text-Aware Visual Reasoning (TAVR) module to enhance model reasoning in object ranking## by explicitly learning a multimodal graph based on the entity and relation cues derived from the description. Extensive experiments demonstrate superior performances of our model on two SOR benchmarks.,0,0
34141,,2503.23220,Large Self-Supervised Models Bridge the Gap in Domain Adaptive Object Detection,The current state-of-the-art methods in domain adaptive object detection (DAOD) use Mean Teacher self-labelling## where a teacher model## directly derived as an exponential moving average of the student model## is used to generate labels on the target domain which are then used to improve both models in a positive loop. This couples learning and generating labels on the target domain## and other recent works also leverage the generated labels to add additional domain alignment losses. We believe this coupling is brittle and excessively constrained: there is no guarantee that a student trained only on source data can generate accurate target domain labels and initiate the positive feedback loop## and much better target domain labels can likely be generated by using a large pretrained network that has been exposed to much more data. Vision foundational models are exactly such models## and they have shown impressive task generalization capabilities even when frozen. We want to leverage these models for DAOD and introduce DINO Teacher## which consists of two components. First## we train a new labeller on source data only using a large frozen DINOv2 backbone and show it generates more accurate labels than Mean Teacher. Next## we align the student's source and target image patch features with those from a DINO encoder## driving source and target representations closer to the generalizable DINO representation.

32922,,2411.15466,Large-Scale Text-to-Image Model with Inpainting is a Zero-Shot Subject-Driven Image Generator,Subject-driven text-to-image generation aims to produce images of a new subject within a desired context by accurately capturing both the visual characteristics of the subject and the semantic content of a text prompt. Traditional methods rely on time- and resource-intensive fine-tuning for subject alignment## while recent zero-shot approaches leverage on-the-fly image prompting## often sacrificing subject alignment. In this paper## we introduce Diptych Prompting## a novel zero-shot approach that reinterprets as an inpainting task with precise subject alignment by leveraging the emergent property of diptych generation in large-scale text-to-image models. Diptych Prompting arranges an incomplete diptych with the reference image in the left panel## and performs text-conditioned inpainting on the right panel. We further prevent unwanted content leakage by removing the background in the reference image and improve fine-grained details in the generated subject by enhancing attention weights between the panels during inpainting. Experimental results confirm that our approach significantly outperforms zero-shot image prompting methods## resulting in images that are visually preferred by users.

33815,,,Large-scale Multi-view Tensor Clustering with Implicit Linear Kernels,Multi-view clustering is a long-standing hot topic in machine learning communities## due to its capability of integrating data information from multiple sources and modalities. By utilizing tensor Singular Value Decomposition (t-SVD) technique with the tensor rotation trick## recent advances have achieved remarkable improvements on clustering performance. However## we find this is attributed to the inadvertent use of sequential information of sorted data samples## i.e. inadvertent label use## which violates the unsupervised learning setting. On the other hand## existing large-scale approaches are mostly developed on the basis of matrix factorization or anchor techniques## thereby fail to consider the similarities among all data samples## preventing from further performance improvement. To address the above issues## we first analyze the tensor rotation trick and recommend to remove it from tensor clustering. On its basis## a novel large-scale multi-view tensor clustering method is developed by incorporating the pair-wise similarities with implicit linear kernel function. To solve the resultant optimization problem## we design an efficient algorithm of linear complexity.Moreover## extensive experiments are conducted and corresponding results well support the aforementioned finding and validate the effectiveness and efficiency of the proposed method.,0,0
32444,,2412.20651,Latent Drifting in Diffusion Models for Counterfactual Medical Image Synthesis,Scaling by training on large datasets has been shown to enhance the quality and fidelity of image generation and manipulation with diffusion models; however## such large datasets are not always accessible in medical imaging due to cost and privacy issues## which contradicts one of the main applications of such models to produce synthetic samples where real data is scarce. Also## finetuning on pre-trained general models has been a challenge due to the distribution shift between the medical domain and the pre-trained models. Here## we propose Latent Drift (LD) for diffusion models that can be adopted for any fine-tuning method to mitigate the issues faced by the distribution shift or employed in inference time as a condition. Latent Drifting enables diffusion models to be conditioned for medical images fitted for the complex task of counterfactual image generation## which is crucial to investigate how parameters such as gender## age## and adding or removing diseases in a patient would alter the medical images. We evaluate our method on three public longitudinal benchmark datasets of brain MRI and chest X-rays for counterfactual image generation.

33286,,2407.07052,Latent Space Imaging,Digital imaging systems have traditionally relied on brute-force measurement and processing of pixels arranged on regular grids. In contrast## the human visual system performs significant data reduction from the large number of photoreceptors to the optic nerve## effectively encoding visual information into a low-bandwidth latent space representation optimized for brain processing. Inspired by this## we propose a similar approach to advance artificial vision systems. Latent Space Imaging introduces a new paradigm that combines optics and software to encode image information directly into the semantically rich latent space of a generative model. This approach substantially reduces bandwidth and memory demands during image capture and enables a range of downstream tasks focused on the latent space.We validate this principle through an initial hardware prototype based on a single-pixel camera. By implementing an amplitude modulation scheme that encodes into the generative model's latent space## we achieve compression ratios ranging from 1:100 to 1:1000 during imaging## and up to 1:16384 for downstream applications. This approach leverages the model's intrinsic linear boundaries## demonstrating the potential of latent space imaging for highly efficient imaging hardware## adaptable future applications in high-speed imaging## and task-specific cameras with significantly reduced hardware complexity.,0,0

Existing diffusion models struggle with scaling beyond their training resolutions## often leading to structural distortions or content repetition. Reference-based methods address the issues by upsampling a low-resolution reference to guide higher-resolution generation. However## they face significant challenges: upsampling in latent space often causes manifold deviation## which degrades output quality. On the other hand## upsampling in RGB space tends to produce overly smoothed outputs. To overcome these limitations## LSRNA combines Latent space Super-Resolution (LSR) for manifold alignment and Region-wise Noise Addition (RNA) to enhance high-frequency details. Our extensive experiments demonstrate that integrating LSRNA outperforms state-of-the-art reference-based methods across various resolutions and metrics## while showing the critical role of latent space upsampling in preserving detail and sharpness.

32763,,,LatentHOI: On the Generalizable Hand Object Motion Generation with Latent Hand Diffusion.,Current research on generating 3D hand-object interaction motion primarily focuses on in-domain objects. Generalization to unseen objects is essential for practical applications## yet it remains both challenging and largely unexplored.In this paper## we propose LatentHOI## a novel approach designed to tackle the challenges of generalizing hand-object interaction to unseen objects.Our main insight lies in decoupling high-level temporal motion from fine-grained spatial hand-object interactions with a latent diffusion model coupled with a Grasping Variational Autoencoder (GraspVAE). This configuration not only enhances the conditional dependency between spatial grasp and temporal motion but also improves data utilization and reduces overfitting through regularization in the latent space. We conducted extensive experiments in an unseen-object setting on both single-hand grasping and bi-manual motion datasets## including GRAB## DexYCB## and OakInk.Quantitative and qualitative evaluations demonstrate that our method significantly enhances the realism and physical plausibility of generated motions for unseen objects## both in single and bimanual manipulations## compared to the state-of-the-art.,0,0
34258,,,Layer- and Timestep-Adaptive Differentiable Token Compression Ratios for Efficient Diffusion Transformers,Diffusion Transformers (DiTs) have achieved state-of-the-art (SOTA) image generation quality but suffer from high latency and memory inefficiency## making them difficult to deploy on resource-constrained devices. One major efficiency bottleneck is that existing DiTs apply equal computation across all regions of an image. However## not all image tokens are equally important## and certain localized areas require more computation## such as objects. To address this## we propose DiffCR## a dynamic DiT inference framework with differentiable compression ratios## which automatically learns to dynamically route computation across layers and timesteps for each image token## resulting in efficient DiTs. Specifically## DiffCR integrates three features: (1) A token-level routing scheme where each DiT layer includes a router that is fine-tuned jointly with model weights to predict token importance scores. In this way## unimportant tokens bypass the entire layer's computation; (2) A layer-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where different DiT layers automatically learn varying compression ratios from a zero initialization## resulting in large compression ratios in redundant layers while others remain less compressed or even uncompressed; (3) A timestep-wise differentiable ratio mechanism where each denoising timestep learns its own compression ratio. The resulting pattern shows higher ratios for noisier timesteps and lower ratios as the image becomes clearer. Extensive experiments on text-to-image and inpainting tasks show that DiffCR effectively captures dynamism across token## layer## and timestep axes## achieving superior trade-offs between generation quality and efficiency compared to prior works.

33813,,,Layered Motion Fusion: Lifting Motion Segmentation to 3D in Egocentric Videos,Computer vision is largely based on 2D techniques## with 3D vision still relegated to a relatively narrow subset of applications. However## by building on recent advances in 3D models such as neural radiance fields## some authors have shown that 3D techniques can at last improve outputs extracted from independent 2D views## by fusing them into 3D and denoising them. This is particularly helpful in egocentric videos## where the camera motion is significant## but only under the assumption that the scene itself is static. In fact## as shown in the recent analysis conducted by EPIC Fields## 3D techniques are ineffective when it comes to studying dynamic phenomena## and## in particular## when segmenting moving objects. In this paper## we look into this issue in more detail. First## we propose to improve dynamic segmentation in 3D by fusing motion segmentation predictions from a 2D-based model into layered radiance fields (Layered Motion Fusion).  However## the high complexity of long## dynamic videos makes it challenging to capture the underlying geometric structure## and## as a result## hinders the fusion of motion cues into the (incomplete) scene geometry. We address this issue through test-time refinement## which helps the model to focus on specific frames## thereby reducing the data complexity. This results in a synergy between motion fusion and the refinement## and in turn leads to segmentation predictions of the 3D model that surpass the 2D baseline by a large margin. This demonstrates that 3D techniques can enhance 2D analysis even for dynamic phenomena in a challenging and realistic setting.,0,0

Specifically## HazeGen harnesses robust generative diffusion priors of real-world hazy images embedded in a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. By employing specialized hybrid training and blended sampling strategies## HazeGen produces realistic and diverse hazy images as high-quality training data for DiffDehaze. To alleviate the inefficiency and fidelity concerns associated with diffusion-based methods## DiffDehaze adopts an Accelerated Fidelity-Preserving Sampling process (AccSamp). The core of AccSamp is the Tiled Statistical Alignment Operation (AlignOp)## which can provide a clean and faithful dehazing estimate within a small fraction of sampling steps to reduce complexity and enable effective fidelity guidance.

33556,,,Learning Partonomic 3D Reconstruction from Image Collections,Reconstructing the 3D shape of an object from a single-view image is a fundamental task in computer vision. Recent advances in differentiable rendering have enabled 3D reconstruction from image collections using only 2D annotations. However## these methods mainly focus on whole-object reconstruction and overlook object partonomy## which is essential for intelligent agents interacting with physical environments. This paper aims at learning partonomic 3D reconstruction from collections of images with only 2D annotations. Our goal is not only to reconstruct the shape of an object from a single-view image but also to decompose the shape into meaningful semantic parts. To handle the expanded solution space and frequent part occlusions in single-view images## we introduce a novel approach that represents## parses## and learns the structural compositionality of 3D objects. This approach comprises: (1) a compact and expressive compositional representation of object geometry## achieved through disentangled modeling of large shape variations## constituent parts## and detailed part deformations as multi-granularity neural fields; (2) a part transformer that recovers precise partonomic geometry and handles occlusions## through effective part-to-pixel grounding and part-to-part relational modeling; and (3) a 2D-supervised learning method that jointly learns the compositional representation and part transformer## by bridging object shape and parts## image synthesis## and differentiable rendering. Extensive experiments on ShapeNetPart## PartNet## and CUB-200-2011 demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on both overall and partonomic reconstruction.

Although numerous deep learning-based turbulence mitigation (TM) methods have been proposed## many are slow## memory-hungry## and do not generalize well. In the spatial domain## methods based on convolutional operators have a limited receptive field## so they cannot handle a large spatial dependency required by turbulence.

MambaTM provides a global receptive field in each layer across spatial and temporal dimensions while maintaining linear computational complexity. (2) Learned Latent Phase Distortion (LPD). LPD guides the state space model. Unlike classical Zernike-based representations of phase distortion## the new LPD map uniquely captures the actual effects of turbulence## significantly improving the model's capability to estimate degradation by reducing the ill-posedness.

32514,,2504.00660,Learning to Normalize on the SPD Manifold under Bures-Wasserstein Geometry,Covariance matrices have proven highly effective across many scientific fields. Since these matrices lie within the Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifold--a Riemannian space with intrinsic non-Euclidean geometry## the primary challenge in representation learning is to respect this underlying geometric structure. Drawing inspiration from the success of Euclidean deep learning## researchers have developed neural networks on the SPD manifolds for more faithful covariance embedding learning. A notable advancement in this area is the implementation of Riemannian batch normalization (RBN)## which has been shown to improve the performance of SPD network models. Nonetheless## the Riemannian metric beneath the existing RBN might fail to effectively deal with the ill-conditioned SPD matrices (ICSM)## undermining the effectiveness of RBN. In contrast## the Bures-Wasserstein metric (BWM) demonstrates superior performance for ill-conditioning. In addition## the recently introduced Generalized BWM (GBWM) parameterizes the vanilla BWM via an SPD matrix## allowing for a more nuanced representation of vibrant geometries of the SPD manifold. Therefore## we propose a novel RBN algorithm based on the GBW geometry## incorporating a learnable metric parameter. Moreover## the deformation of GBWM by matrix power is also introduced to further enhance the representational capacity of GBWM-based RBN. Experimental results on different datasets validate the effectiveness of our proposed method. The code is available at https://github.com/jjscc/GBWBN.,0,0

Recent advances in text-to-image diffusion models have achieved impressive image generation capabilities. However## it remains challenging to control the generation process with desired properties (e.g.## aesthetic quality## user intention)## which can be expressed as black-box reward functions. In this paper## we focus on prompt adaptation## which refines the original prompt into model-preferred prompts to generate desired images. While prior work uses reinforcement learning (RL) to optimize prompts## we observe that applying RL often results in generating similar postfixes and deterministic behaviors. To this end## we introduce Prompt Adaptation with GFlowNets (PAG)## a novel approach that frames prompt adaptation as a probabilistic inference problem. Our key insight is that leveraging Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) allows us to shift from reward maximization to sampling from an unnormalized density function## enabling both high-quality and diverse prompt generation. However## we identify that a naive application of GFlowNets suffers from mode collapse and uncovers a previously overlooked phenomenon: the progressive loss of neural plasticity in the model## which is compounded by inefficient credit assignment in sequential prompt generation. To address this critical challenge## we develop a systematic approach in PAG with flow reactivation## reward-prioritized sampling## and reward decomposition for prompt adaptation. Extensive experiments validate that PAG successfully learns to sample effective and diverse prompts for text-to-image generation. We also show that PAG exhibits strong robustness across various reward functions and transferability to different text-to-image models.,0,0
33393,,,Learning with Noisy Triplet Correspondence for Composed Image Retrieval,Composed Image Retrieval (CIR) enables editable image search by integrating a query pair--a reference image ref and a textual modification mod--to retrieve a target image tar that reflects the intended change. While existing CIR methods have shown promising performance using well-annotated triplets \langle ref## mod## tar \rangle## almost all of them implicitly assume these triplets are accurately associated with each other. In practice## however## this assumption is often violated due to the limited knowledge of annotators## inevitably leading to incorrect textual modifications and resulting in a practical yet less-touched problem: noisy triplet correspondence (NTC). To tackle this challenge## we propose a \underline T ask-oriented \underline M odification \underline E nhancement framework (TME) to learn robustly from noisy triplets## which comprises three key modules: Robust Fusion Query (RFQ)## Pseudo Text Enhancement (PTE)## and Task-Oriented Prompt (TOP). Specifically## to mitigate the adverse impact of noise## RFQ employs a sample selection strategy to divide the training triplets into clean and noisy sets## thus enhancing the reliability of the training data for robust learning. To further leverage the noisy data instead of discarding it## PTE unifies the triplet noise as an adapter mismatch problem## thereby adjusting mod to align with ref and tar in the mismatched triplet. Finally## TOP replaces ref in the clean set with a trainable prompt## which is then concatenated with mod to form a query independent of the visual reference## aiming to mitigate visually irrelevant noise. Extensive experiments on two domain-specific datasets demonstrate the robustness and superiority of TME## particularly in noisy scenarios.,0,0

32442,,,Less Attention is More: Prompt Transformer for Generalized Category Discovery,Generalized Category Discovery (GCD) typically relies on the pre-trained Vision Transformer (ViT) to extract features from a global receptive field## followed by contrastive learning to simultaneously classify unlabeled known classes and unknown classes without priors. Owing to the deficiency in the modeling capacity for inner-patch local information within ViT## current methods primarily focus on discriminative features at global level. This results in a model with more yet scattered attention## where neither excessive nor insufficient focus can grasp subtle differences to classify fine-grained unknown and known categories. To address this issue## we propose the AptGCD to deliver apt attention for GCD. It mimics the human brain how leveraging visual perception to refine local attention and comprehend global context by proposing a Meta Visual Prompt (MVP) and Prompt Transformer (PT). MVP is introduced into GCD for the first time## refining channel-level attention## while adaptively self-learning unique inner-patch features as prompts to achieve local visual modeling for our prompt transformer. Yet## relying solely on detailed features can lead to skewed judgments. Hence## PT harmonizes local and global representations## guiding the model's interpretation of features through broader contexts## thereby capturing more useful details with less attention. Extensive experiments on seven datasets demonstrate that AptGCD outperforms current methods## it achieves an average proportional 'New' accuracy improvement of approximately 9.2% over SOTA method on the all four fine-grained datasets## establishing a new standard in the field.

33802,,,Less is More: Efficient Image Vectorization with Adaptive Parameterization,Image vectorization aims to convert raster images to vector ones## allowing for easy scaling and editing.Existing works mainly rely on preset parameters (i.e.## a fixed number of paths and control points)## ignoring the complexity of the image and posing significant challenges to practical applications.We demonstrate that such an assumption is often incorrect## as the preset paths or control points may be neither essential nor enough to achieve accurate and editable vectorization results.Based on this key insight## in this paper## we propose AdaVec## an efficient image vectorization method with adaptive parametrization## where the paths and control points can be adjusted dynamically based on the complexity of the input raster image.In particular## we first decompose the input raster image into a set of pure-colored layers that are aligned with human perception.For each layer with varying shape complexity## we propose a novel allocation mechanism to adaptively adjust the control point distribution.We further adopt a differentiable rendering process to compose and optimize the shape and color parameters of each layer iteratively.Extensive experiments demonstrate that AdaVec outperforms the baselines qualitatively and quantitatively## in terms of computational efficiency##  vectorization accuracy## and editing flexibility.,0,0
34651,,2412.00054,Less is More: Efficient Model Merging with Binary Task Switch,As an effective approach to equip models with multi-task capabilities without additional training## model merging has garnered significant attention. However## existing merging methods face challenges of redundant parameter conflicts and the excessive storage burden of fine-tuned parameters. In this work## through controlled experiments## we reveal that for fine-tuned task vectors## only those parameters with magnitudes above a certain threshold contribute positively to the task## exhibiting a pulse-like characteristic. We then attempt leveraging this pulse-like characteristic to binarize the task vectors and reduce storage overhead. Further controlled experiments show that the binarized task vectors incur almost no decrease in fine-tuning and merging performance## and even exhibit stronger performance improvements as the proportion of redundant parameters increases. Based on these insights## we propose Task Switch (T-Switch)## which decomposes task vectors into three components: 1) an activation switch instantiated by a binarized mask vector## 2) a polarity switch instantiated by a binarized sign vector## and 3) a scaling knob instantiated by a scalar coefficient. By storing task vectors in a binarized form## T-Switch alleviates parameter conflicts while ensuring efficient task parameter storage. Furthermore## to enable automated switch combination in T-Switch## we further introduce Auto-Switch## which enables training-free switch combination via retrieval from a small query set.

34302,,2409.16434,Lessons and Insights from a Unifying Study of Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) in Visual Recognition,Parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) has attracted significant attention due to the growth of pre-trained model sizes and the need to fine-tune (FT) them for superior downstream performance. Despite a surge in new PEFT methods## a systematic study to understand their performance and suitable application scenarios is lacking## leaving questions like 'when to apply PEFT' and 'which method to use' largely unanswered## especially in visual recognition. In this paper## we conduct a unifying empirical study of representative PEFT methods with Vision Transformers. We systematically tune their hyperparameters to fairly compare their accuracy on downstream tasks. Our study offers a practical user guide and unveils several new insights. First## if tuned carefully## different PEFT methods achieve similar accuracy in the low-shot benchmark VTAB-1K. This includes simple approaches like FT the bias terms that were reported inferior. Second## despite similar accuracy## we find that PEFT methods make different mistakes and high-confidence predictions## likely due to their different inductive biases. Such an inconsistency (or complementarity) opens up the opportunity for ensemble methods## and we make preliminary attempts at this. Third## going beyond the commonly used low-shot tasks## we find that PEFT is also useful in many-shot regimes## achieving comparable or better accuracy than full FT while using significantly fewer parameters. Lastly## we investigate PEFT's ability to preserve a pre-trained model's robustness to distribution shifts (e.g.## CLIP). Perhaps not surprisingly## PEFT approaches outperform full FT alone. However## with weight-space ensembles## full FT  can better balance target distribution and distribution shift performance## suggesting a future research direction for robust PEFT.

34895,,,Let Samples Speak: Mitigating Spurious Correlation by Exploiting the Clusterness of Samples,Deep learning models are known to often learn features that spuriously correlate with the class label during training but are irrelevant to the prediction task. Existing methods typically address this issue by annotating potential spurious attributes## or filtering spurious features based on some empirical assumptions (e.g.## simplicity of bias). However## these methods may yield unsatisfying performance due to the intricate and elusive nature of spurious correlations in real-world data. In this paper## we propose a data-oriented approach to mitigate the spurious correlation in deep learning models. We observe that samples that are influenced by spurious features tend to exhibit a dispersed distribution in the learned feature space. This allows us to identify the presence of spurious features. Subsequently## we obtain a bias-invariant representation by neutralizing the spuriousfeatures based on a simple grouping strategy. Then## we learn a feature transformation to eliminate the spuriousfeatures by aligning with this bias-invariant representation. Finally## we update the classifier by incorporating the learned feature transformation and obtain an unbiased model. By integrating the aforementioned identifying## neutralizing## eliminating and updating procedures## we build an effective pipeline for mitigating spurious correlation. Experiments on image and NLP debiasing benchmarks show an improvement in worst group accuracy of more than 20% compared to standard empirical risk minimization (ERM).

34817,,,Libra-Merging: Importance-redundancy and Pruning-merging Trade-off for Acceleration Plug-in in Large Vision-Language Model,Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have achieved significant progress in recent years. However## the expensive inference cost limits the realistic deployment of LVLMs. Some works find that visual tokens are redundant and compress tokens to reduce the inference cost. These works identify important non-redundant tokens as target tokens## then prune the remaining tokens (non-target tokens) or merge them into target tokens. However## target token identification faces the token importance-redundancy dilemma. Besides## token merging and pruning face a dilemma between disrupting target token information and losing non-target token information. To solve these problems## we propose a novel visual token compression scheme## named Libra-Merging. In target token identification## Libra-Merging selects the most important tokens from spatially discrete intervals## achieving a more robust token importance-redundancy trade-off than relying on a hyper-parameter. In token compression## when non-target tokens are dissimilar to target tokens## Libra-Merging does not merge them into the target tokens## thus avoiding disrupting target token information. Meanwhile## Libra-Merging condenses these non-target tokens into an information compensation token to prevent losing important non-target token information.

While some editors demonstrate strong robustness for lifelong editing in pure LLMs## Vision LLMs (VLLMs)## which incorporate an additional vision modality## are not directly adaptable to existing LLM editors.

A hard filtering mechanism is developed to utilize visual semantic knowledge## thereby coarsely eliminating visually irrelevant experts for input queries during the inference stage of the post-edited model. Finally## to integrate visually relevant experts## we introduce a soft routing mechanism based on textual semantic relevance to achieve multi-expert fusion. For evaluation## we establish a benchmark for lifelong VLLM editing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that LiveEdit offers significant advantages in lifelong VLLM editing scenarios.

35089,,2412.10831,Low-Biased General Annotated Dataset Generation,Pre-training backbone networks on a general annotated dataset (e.g.## ImageNet) that comprises numerous manually collected images with category annotations has proven to be indispensable for enhancing the generalization capacity of downstream visual tasks. However## those manually collected images often exhibit bias## which is non-transferable across either categories or domains## thus causing the model's generalization capacity degeneration. To mitigate this problem## we present a low-biased general annotated dataset generation framework (lbGen). Instead of expensive manual collection## we aim at directly generating low-biased images with category annotations. To achieve this goal## we propose to leverage the advantage of a multimodal foundation model (e.g.## CLIP)## in terms of aligning images in a low-biased semantic space defined by language. Specifically## we develop a bi-level semantic alignment loss## which not only forces all generated images to be consistent with the semantic distribution of all categories belonging to the target dataset in an adversarial learning manner## but also requires each generated image to match the semantic description of its category name. In addition## we further cast an existing image quality scoring model into a quality assurance loss to preserve the quality of the generated image. By leveraging these two loss functions## we can obtain a low-biased image generation model by simply fine-tuning a pre-trained diffusion model using only all category names in the target dataset as input. Experimental results confirm that## compared with the manually labeled dataset or other synthetic datasets## the utilization of our generated low-biased dataset leads to stable generalization capacity enhancement of different backbone networks across various tasks## especially in tasks where the manually labeled samples are scarce.,0,0

The core idea is to encode the 2D video to compact spatial codes## considering the inherent 3D nature of video occurrence. Concretely## we lift the 2D frame pixels into 3D using monocular depth estimators## and decompose the video clip into three spatial components (i.e.## main human## underlying scene## and floating occlusion) in hierarchical layers based on the 3D depth. These components are further encoded to canonical identity code## structured motion code and full scene code## which are utilized as control signals of the synthesis process. The design of spatial decomposed modeling enables flexible user control## complex motion expression## as well as 3D-aware synthesis for scene interactions. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms prior works by a large margin in character animation synthesis and is effective in providing a high degree of controllability (i.e.## arbitrary characters## novel 3D motions## interactive scenes)## thus enabling brand-new editing tasks (e.g.## video character replacement).,0,0

34112,,,MIRE: Matched Implicit Neural Representations,Implicit Neural Representations (INRs) are continuous function learners for conventional digital signal representations. With the aid of positional embeddings and/or exhaustively fine-tuned activation functions## INRs have surpassed many limitations of traditional discrete representations.

Thus## it becomes crucial to identify such unsafe images based on established safety rules. Pre-trained Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) offer potential in this regard## given their strong pattern recognition abilities. Existing approaches typically fine-tune MLLMs with human-labeled datasets## which however brings a series of drawbacks. First## relying on human annotators to label data following intricate and detailed guidelines is both expensive and labor-intensive. Furthermore## users of safety judgment systems may need to frequently update safety rules## making fine-tuning on human-based annotation more challenging. This raises the research question: Can we detect unsafe images by querying MLLMs in a zero-shot setting using a predefined safety constitution (a set of safety rules)? Our research showed that simply querying pre-trained MLLMs does not yield satisfactory results. This lack of effectiveness stems from factors such as the subjectivity of safety rules## the complexity of lengthy constitutions## and the inherent biases in the models. To address these challenges## we propose a MLLM-based method includes objectifying safety rules## assessing the relevance between rules and images## making quick judgments based on debiased token probabilities with logically complete yet simplified precondition chains for safety rules## and conducting more in-depth reasoning with cascaded chain-of-thought processes if necessary.

However## adapting these models with limited few-shot data often leads to overfitting## diminishing their performance on new tasks. To tackle this issue## we propose a novel Multi-Modal Representation Learning (MMRL) framework that introduces a shared## learnable## and modality-agnostic representation space. MMRL projects the space tokens to text and image representation tokens## facilitating more effective multi-modal interactions.

During training## both representation and class features are optimized## with trainable projection layer applied to the representation tokens## whereas the class token projection layer remains frozen to retain pre-trained knowledge. Furthermore## a regularization term is introduced to align the class features and text features with the zero-shot features from the frozen VLM## thereby safeguarding the model's generalization capacity. For inference## a decoupling strategy is employed## wherein both representation and class features are utilized for base classes## while only the class features## which retain more generalized knowledge## are used for new tasks.

MMVU includes 3##000 expert-annotated questions spanning 27 subjects across four core disciplines: Science## Healthcare## Humanities & Social Sciences## and Engineering. Compared to prior benchmarks## MMVU features three key advancements. First## it challenges models to apply domain-specific knowledge and perform expert-level reasoning to analyze specialized-domain videos## moving beyond the basic visual perception typically assessed in current video benchmarks. Second## each example is annotated by human experts from scratch. We implement strict data quality controls to ensure the high quality of the dataset.

35231,,,MNE-SLAM: Multi-Agent Neural SLAM for Mobile Robots,Neural implicit scene representations have recently shown promising results in dense visual SLAM. However## existing implicit SLAM algorithms are constrained to single-agent scenarios## and fall difficulty in large indoor scenes and long sequences. Existing multi-agent SLAM frameworks cannot meet the constraints of communication bandwidth. To this end## we propose the first distributed multi-agent collaborative SLAM framework with distributed mapping and camera tracking## joint scene representation## intra-to-inter loop closure## and multi-submap fusion. Specifically## our proposed distributed neural mapping and tracking framework only needs peer-to-peer communication## which can greatly improve multi-agent cooperation and communication efficiency. A novel intra-to-inter loop closure method is designed to achieve local (single-agent) and global (multi-agent) consistency. Furthermore## to the best of our knowledge## there is no real-world dataset for NeRF-based/GS-based SLAM that provides both continuous-time trajectories groundtruth and high-accuracy 3D meshes groundtruth. To this end## we propose the first real-world indoor neural slam (INS) dataset covering both single-agent and multi-agent scenarios## ranging from small room to large-scale scenes## with high-accuracy ground truth for both 3D mesh and continuous-time camera trajectory. This dataset can advance the development of the community. Experiments on various datasets demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in both mapping## tracking## and communication.

However## these methods are mostly limited to a single object; directly applying such methods to compositional multi-object scenarios yields inferior results## especially incorrect object placement and inconsistent shape and appearance under novel views. How to enhance and systematically evaluate the cross-view consistency of such models remains under-explored. To address this issue## we propose MOVIS to enhance the structural awareness of the view-conditioned diffusion model for multi-object NVS in terms of model inputs## auxiliary tasks## and training strategy.

Second## we introduce an auxiliary task requiring the model to simultaneously predict novel view object masks## further improving the model's capability in differentiating and placing objects. Finally## we conduct an in-depth analysis of the diffusion sampling process and carefully devise a structure-guided timestep sampling scheduler during training## which balances the learning of global object placement and fine-grained detail recovery. To systematically evaluate the plausibility of synthesized images## we propose to assess cross-view consistency and novel view object placement alongside existing image-level NVS metrics.

Because capturing images that avoid these pitfalls is challenging## this severely limits the wider use of SfM## especially by non-expert users. We overcome these limitations by augmenting the classical SfM paradigm with monocular depth and normal priors inferred by deep neural networks. Thanks to a tight integration of monocular and multi-view constraints## our approach significantly outperforms existing ones under extreme viewpoint changes## while maintaining strong performance in standard conditions. We also show that monocular priors can help reject faulty associations due to symmetries## which is a long-standing problem for SfM. This makes our approach the first capable of reliably reconstructing challenging indoor environments from few images. Through principled uncertainty propagation## it is robust to errors in the priors## can handle priors inferred by different models with little tuning## and will thus easily benefit from future progress in monocular depth and normal estimation.

33635,,2406.10210,Make It Count: Text-to-Image Generation with an Accurate Number of Objects,Despite the unprecedented success of text-to-image diffusion models## controlling the number of depicted objects using text is surprisingly hard. This is important for various applications from technical documents## to children's books to illustrating cooking recipes. Generating object-correct counts is fundamentally challenging because the generative model needs to keep a sense of separate identity for every instance of the object## even if several objects look identical or overlap## and then carry out a global computation implicitly during generation. It is still unknown if such representations exist. To address count-correct generation## we first identify features within the diffusion model that can carry the object identity information. We then use them to separate and count instances of objects during the denoising process and detect over-generation and under-generation. We fix the latter by training a model that predicts both the shape and location of a missing object## based on the layout of existing ones## and show how it can be used to guide denoising with correct object count. Our approach## CountGen## does not depend on external source to determine object layout## but rather uses the prior from the diffusion model itself## creating prompt-dependent and seed-dependent layouts. Evaluated on two benchmark datasets## we find that CountGen strongly outperforms the count-accuracy of existing baselines.,0,0
34013,,,Make-It-Animatable: An Efficient Framework for Authoring Animation-Ready 3D Characters,3D characters are essential to modern creative industries## but making them animatable often demands extensive manual work in tasks like rigging and skinning. Existing automatic rigging tools face several limitations## including the necessity for manual annotations## rigid skeleton topologies## and limited generalization across diverse shapes and poses. An alternative approach generates animatable avatars pre-bound to a rigged template mesh. However## this method often lacks flexibility and is typically limited to realistic human shapes. To address these issues## we present Make-It-Animatable## a novel data-driven method to make any 3D humanoid model ready for character animation in less than one second## regardless of its shapes and poses.

32595,,2504.03193,Mamba as a Bridge: Where Vision Foundation Models Meet Vision Language Models for Domain-Generalized Semantic Segmentation,Vision Foundation Models (VFMs) and Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have gained traction in Domain Generalized Semantic Segmentation (DGSS) due to their strong generalization capabilities. However## existing DGSS methods often rely exclusively on either VFMs or VLMs## overlooking their complementary strengths. VFMs (e.g.## DINOv2) excel at capturing fine-grained features## while VLMs (e.g.## CLIP) provide robust text alignment but struggle with coarse granularity. Despite their complementary strengths## effectively integrating VFMs and VLMs with attention mechanisms is challenging## as the increased patch tokens complicate long-sequence modeling. To address this## we propose MFuser## a novel Mamba-based fusion framework that efficiently combines the strengths of VFMs and VLMs while maintaining linear scalability in sequence length. MFuser consists of two key components: MVFuser## which acts as a co-adapter to jointly fine-tune the two models by capturing both sequential and spatial dynamics; and MTEnhancer## a hybrid attention-Mamba module that refines text embeddings by incorporating image priors. Our approach achieves precise feature locality and strong text alignment without incurring significant computational overhead. Extensive experiments demonstrate that MFuser significantly outperforms state-of-the-art DGSS methods## achieving 68.20 mIoU on synthetic-to-real and 71.87 mIoU on real-to-real benchmarks.

34117,,,Mamba-Adaptor: State Space Model Adaptor for Visual Recognition,Recent State Space Models (SSM)## especially Mamba## have demonstrated impressive performance in visual modeling and possess superior model efficiency. However## the application of Mamba to visual tasks suffers inferior performance due to three main constraints existing in the sequential model: 1) Casual computing is incapable of accessing global context; 2) Long-range forgetting occurs when computing the current hidden states; 3) Weak spatial structural modeling due to the transformed sequential input. To address these issues## we investigate a simple yet powerful vision task adapter for Mamba models## which consists of two functional modules: Adaptor-T and Adapator-S. When solving the hidden states for SSM## we apply a casual prediction module Adaptor-T to select a set of learnable locations as memory augmentation feature states to ease long-range forgetting issues. Moreover## we leverage Adapator-S## composed of multi-scale dilated convolutional kernels## to enhance the spatial modeling and introduce the image inductive bias into the feature output. Both modules can enlarge the context modeling in casual computing## as the output is enhanced by the inaccessible features. We explore three usages of Mamba-Adaptor: A general visual backbone for various vision tasks; A booster module to raise the performance of pretrained backbones; A highly efficient fine-tuning module that adapts the base model for transfer learning tasks. Extensive experiments verify the effectiveness of Mamba-Adapter in three settings. Notably## our Mamba-Adapter achieves state-of-the-art performance on the ImageNet and COCO benchmarks.,0,0

33055,,2405.07992,MambaOut: Do We Really Need Mamba for Vision?,Mamba## an architecture with RNN-like token mixer of state space model (SSM)## was recently introduced to address the quadratic complexity of the attention mechanism and subsequently applied to vision tasks. Nevertheless## the performance of Mamba for vision is often underwhelming when compared with convolutional and attention-based models. In this paper## we delve into the essence of Mamba## and conceptually conclude that Mamba is ideally suited for tasks with long-sequence and autoregressive characteristics. For vision tasks## as image classification on ImageNet does not align with either characteristic## we hypothesize that Mamba is not necessary for this task; Detection and segmentation tasks on COCO or ADE20K are also not autoregressive## yet they adhere to the long-sequence characteristic## so we believe it is still worthwhile to explore Mamba's potential for these tasks. To empirically verify our hypotheses## we construct a series of models named MambaOut through stacking Mamba blocks while removing their core token mixer## SSM. Experimental results strongly support our hypotheses. Specifically## our MambaOut model surpasses all visual Mamba models on ImageNet image classification## indicating that Mamba is indeed unnecessary for this task.

Then the initialized PFG is processed by a proposed Geometric Mamba Module (GMM)## which exploits the matching features to refine the overall inter-frame pixel-to-pixel matching.  The refined PFG is finally processed by deep BA to optimize the poses and the map. To deal with the gradient variance## a Trending-Aware Penalty (TAP) is proposed to smooth training by balancing the pose loss and the matching loss to enhance convergence and stability.

The key challenge for ZS-CIR tasks is to modify a reference image according to manipulation text to accurately retrieve a target image## especially when the reference image is missing essential target content. In this paper## we propose a novel prediction-based mapping network## named PrediCIR## to adaptively predict the missing target visual content in reference images in the latent space before mapping for accurate ZS-CIR. Specifically## a world view generation module first constructs a source view by omitting certain visual content of a target view## coupled with an action that includes the manipulation intent derived from existing image-caption pairs. Then## a target content prediction module trains a world model as a predictor to adaptively predict the missing visual information guided by user intention in manipulating text at the latent space. The two modules map an image with the predicted relevant information to a pseudo-word token without extra supervision. Our model shows strong generalization ability on six ZS-CIR tasks. It obtains consistent and significant performance boosts ranging from 1.73% to 4.45% over the best methods and achieves new state-of-the-art results on ZS-CIR.

33206,,2503.08352,Mitigating Ambiguities in 3D Classification with Gaussian Splatting,3D classification with point cloud input is a fundamental problem in 3D vision. However## due to the discrete nature and the insufficient material description of point cloud representations## there are ambiguities in distinguishing wire-like and flat surfaces## as well as transparent or reflective objects. To address these issues## we propose Gaussian Splatting (GS) point cloud-based 3D classification. We find that the scale and rotation coefficients in the GS point cloud help characterize surface types. Specifically## wire-like surfaces consist of multiple slender Gaussian ellipsoids## while flat surfaces are composed of a few flat Gaussian ellipsoids. Additionally## the opacity in the GS point cloud represents the transparency characteristics of objects. As a result## ambiguities in point cloud-based 3D classification can be mitigated utilizing GS point cloud as input. To verify the effectiveness of GS point cloud input## we construct the first real-world GS point cloud dataset in the community## which includes 20 categories with 200 objects in each category. Experiments not only validate the superiority of GS point cloud input## especially in distinguishing ambiguous objects## but also demonstrate the generalization ability across different classification methods.,0,0
33633,,2501.09695,Mitigating Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models via DPO: On-Policy Data Hold the Key,Hallucination remains a major challenge for Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs). Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has gained increasing attention as a simple solution to hallucination issues. It directly learns from constructed preference pairs that reflect the severity of hallucinations in responses to the same prompt and image. Nonetheless## different data construction methods in existing works bring notable performance variations. We identify a crucial factor here: outcomes are largely contingent on whether the constructed data aligns on-policy w.r.t the initial (reference) policy of DPO. Theoretical analysis suggests that learning from off-policy data is impeded by the presence of KL-divergence between the updated policy and the reference policy. From the perspective of dataset distribution## we systematically summarize the inherent flaws in existing algorithms that employ DPO to address hallucination issues. To alleviate the problems## we propose On-Policy Alignment (OPA)-DPO framework## which uniquely leverages expert feedback to correct hallucinated responses and aligns both the original and expert-revised responses in an on-policy manner. Notably## with only 4.8k data## OPA-DPO achieves an additional reduction in the hallucination rate of  LLaVA-1.5-7B: 13.26% on the AMBER benchmark and 5.39% on the Object-Hal benchmark## compared to the previous SOTA algorithm trained with 16k samples.,0,0
33641,,2406.12718,Mitigating Object Hallucinations in Large Vision-Language Models with Assembly of Global and Local Attention,Despite great success across various multimodal tasks## Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) often encounter object hallucinations with generated textual responses being inconsistent with the actual objects in images. We examine different LVLMs and pinpoint that one root cause of object hallucinations lies with deficient attention on discriminative image features. Specifically## LVLMs often predominantly attend to prompt-irrelevant global features instead of prompt-relevant local features## undermining their visual grounding capacity and leading to object hallucinations. We propose Assembly of Global and Local Attention (AGLA) ## a training-free and plug-and-play approach that mitigates hallucinations by assembling global features for response generation and local features for visual discrimination simultaneously.  Specifically## we introduce an image-prompt matching scheme that captures prompt-relevant local features from images## leading to an augmented view of the input image where prompt-relevant content is highlighted while irrelevant distractions are suppressed.  Hallucinations can thus be mitigated with a calibrated logit distribution that is from generative global features of the original image and discriminative local features of the augmented image. Extensive experiments show the superiority of AGLA in LVLM hallucination mitigation## demonstrating its wide applicability across both discriminative and generative tasks.

To that end## prior works have proposed to combine several motion diffusion models pre-trained on datasets with different types of conditions## thus allowing control with multiple conditions. However## the proposed merging strategies overlook that the optimal way to combine the generation processes might depend on the particularities of each pre-trained generative model and also the specific textual descriptions. In this context## we introduce MixerMDM## the first learnable model composition technique for combining pre-trained text-conditioned human motion diffusion models. Unlike previous approaches## MixerMDM provides a dynamic mixing strategy that is trained in an adversarial fashion to learn to combine the denoising process of each model depending on the set of conditions driving the generation. By using MixerMDM to combine single- and multi-person motion diffusion models## we achieve fine-grained control on the dynamics of every person individually## and also on the overall interaction. Furthermore## we propose a new evaluation technique that## for the first time in this task## measures the interaction and individual quality by computing the alignment between the mixed generated motions and their conditions as well as the capabilities of MixerMDM to adapt the mixing throughout the denoising process depending on the motions to mix.,0,0

Despite delivering remarkable rendering quality and speed## existing methods struggle with storage demands and the representation of complex real-world motions. To address these challenges## we propose MoDec-GS## a memory-efficient Gaussian splatting framework designed to reconstruct novel views in challenging scenarios with complex motions. We introduce Global-to-Local Motion Decomposition (GLMD) to effectively capture dynamic motions in a coarse-to-fine manner. This approach leverages Global Canonical Scaffolds (Global CS) and Local Canonical Scaffolds (Local CS)## which extend static Scaffold representation to dynamic video reconstruction. For Global CS## we propose Global Anchor Deformation (GAD) to efficiently represent global dynamics along complex motions by directly deforming the implicit Scaffold attributes## including anchor position## offset## and local context features. Next## we finely adjust local motions via the Local Gaussian Deformation (LGD) of Local CS explicitly. Additionally## we introduce Temporal Interval Adjustment (TIA) to automatically control the temporal coverage of each Local CS during training## enabling MoDec-GS to find optimal interval assignments based on the specified number of temporal segments. Extensive evaluations demonstrate that MoDec-GS achieves an average 70% reduction in model size over state-of-the-art methods for dynamic 3D Gaussians from real-world dynamic videos while maintaining or even improving rendering quality.,0,0

Current methods face fundamental challenges: a) the absence of frameworks for modeling single basic emotional expressions## which restricts the generation of complex emotions such as compound emotions; b) the lack of comprehensive datasets rich in human emotional expressions## which limits the potential of models. To address these challenges## we propose the following innovations: 1) the Mixture of Emotion Experts (MoEE) model## which decouples six fundamental emotions to enable the precise synthesis of both singular and compound emotional states; 2) the DH-FaceEmoVid-150 dataset## specifically curated to include six prevalent human emotional expressions as well as four types of compound emotions## thereby expanding the training potential of emotion-driven models; 3) an emotion-to-latents module that leverages multimodal inputs## aligning diverse control signals--such as audio## text## and labels--to enhance audio-driven emotion control.

Recent works introduce pretrained Diffusion Models (DMs) into this task. However## due to the scarcity of large-scale training data and comprehensive benchmarks## the optimal methodologies for employing DMs in stereo conversion and the accurate evaluation of stereo effects remain largely unexplored. In this work## we introduce the Mono2Stereo dataset## providing high-quality training data and benchmark to support in-depth exploration of stereo conversion.

34974,,,Mono3DVLT: Monocular-Video-Based 3D Visual Language Tracking,Visual-Language Tracking (VLT) is emerging as a promising paradigm to bridge the human-machine performance gap. For single objects## VLT broadens the problem scope to text-driven video comprehension. Yet## this direction is still confined to 2D spatial extents## currently lacking the ability to deal with 3D tracking in the confines of monocular video. Unfortunately## advances in 3D tracking mainly rely on expensive sensor inputs## e.g.## point clouds## depth measurements## radar. Absence of language counterpart for the outputs of these mildly democratized sensors in the literature also hinders VLT expansion to 3D tracking. Addressing that## we make the first attempt towards extending VLT to 3D tracking based on monocular video. We present a comprehensive framework## introducing (i) the Monocular-Video-based 3D Visual Language Tracking (Mono3DVLT) task## (ii) a large-scale dataset  for the task## called Mono3DVLT-V2X## and (iii) a customized neural model for the task.

32685,,2410.19590,MonoDGP: Monocular 3D Object Detection with Decoupled-Query and Geometry-Error Priors,Perspective projection has been extensively utilized in monocular 3D object detection methods. It introduces geometric priors from 2D bounding boxes and 3D object dimensions to reduce the uncertainty of depth estimation. However## due to errors originating from the object's visual surface## the bounding box height often fails to represent the actual central height## which undermines the effectiveness of geometric depth. Direct prediction for the projected height unavoidably results in a loss of 2D priors## while multi-depth prediction with complex branches does not fully leverage geometric depth. This paper presents a Transformer-based monocular 3D object detection method called MonoDGP## which adopts perspective-invariant geometry errors to modify the projection formula. We also try to systematically discuss and explain the mechanisms and efficacy behind geometry errors## which serve as a simple but effective alternative to multi-depth prediction. Additionally## MonoDGP decouples the depth-guided decoder and constructs a 2D decoder only dependent on visual features## providing 2D priors and initializing object queries without the disturbance of 3D detection. To further optimize and fine-tune input tokens of the transformer decoder## we also introduce a Region Segmentation Head (RSH) that generates enhanced features and segment embeddings.

However## due to the inconsistent prediction on each view## how to more effectively leverage monocular cues in a multi-view context remains a challenge. Current methods treat the entire estimated depth map indiscriminately## and use it as ground truth supervision## while ignoring the inherent inaccuracy and cross-view inconsistency in monocular priors. To resolve these issues## we propose MonoInstance## a general approach that explores the uncertainty of monocular depths to provide enhanced geometric priors for neural rendering and reconstruction. Our key insight lies in aligning each segmented instance depths from multiple views within a common 3D space## thereby casting the uncertainty estimation of monocular depths into a density measure within noisy point clouds. For high-uncertainty areas where depth priors are unreliable## we further introduce a constraint term that encourages the projected instances to align with corresponding instance masks on nearby views. MonoInstance is a versatile strategy which can be seamlessly integrated into various multi-view neural rendering frameworks. Our experimental results demonstrate that MonoInstance significantly improves the performance in both reconstruction and novel view synthesis under various benchmarks.,0,0

32680,,2505.20287,MotionPro: A Precise Motion Controller for Image-to-Video Generation,Animating images with interactive motion control has garnered popularity for image-to-video (I2V) generation. Modern approaches typically rely on large Gaussian kernels to extend motion trajectories as condition without explicitly defining movement region## leading to coarse motion control and failing to disentangle object and camera moving. To alleviate these## we present MotionPro## a precise motion controller that novelly leverages region-wise trajectory and motion mask to regulate fine-grained motion synthesis and identify target motion category (i.e.## object or camera moving)## respectively. Technically## MotionPro first estimates the flow maps on each training video via a tracking model## and then samples the region-wise trajectories to simulate inference scenario. Instead of extending flow through large Gaussian kernels## our region-wise trajectory approach enables more precise control by directly utilizing trajectories within local regions## thereby effectively characterizing fine-grained movements. A motion mask is simultaneously derived from the predicted flow maps to capture the holistic motion dynamics of the movement regions. To pursue natural motion control## MotionPro further strengthens video denoising by incorporating both region-wise trajectories and motion mask through feature modulation.

This problem poses two challenges## the interference of similar source-class knowledge in target-class representation learning and the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones. To address them## we propose the Multi-Granularity Class Prototype Topology Distillation (GROTO) algorithm## which effectively transfers the source knowledge to the class-incremental target domain. Concretely## we design the multi-granularity class prototype self-organization module and the prototype topology distillation module. First## we mine the positive classes by modeling accumulation distributions. Next## we introduce multi-granularity class prototypes to generate reliable pseudo-labels## and exploit them to promote the positive-class target feature self-organization. Second## the positive-class prototypes are leveraged to construct the topological structures of source and target feature spaces. Then## we perform the topology distillation to continually mitigate the shocks of new target knowledge to old ones.

34035,,2505.24023,Multi-Group Proportional Representations for Text-to-Image Models,Text-to-image (T2I) generative models can create vivid## realistic images from textual descriptions. As these models proliferate## they expose new concerns about their ability to represent diverse demographic groups## propagate stereotypes## and efface minority populations. Despite growing attention to the 'safe' and 'responsible' design of artificial intelligence (AI)## there is no established methodology to systematically measure and control representational harms in image generation. This paper introduces a novel framework to measure the representation of intersectional groups in images generated by T2I models by applying the Multi-Group Proportional Representation (MPR) metric. MPR evaluates the worst-case deviation of representation statistics across given population groups in images produced by a generative model## allowing for flexible and context-specific measurements based on user requirements. We also develop an algorithm to optimize T2I models for this metric. Through experiments## we demonstrate that MPR can effectively measure representation statistics across multiple intersectional groups and## when used as a training objective## can guide models toward a more balanced generation across demographic groups while maintaining generation quality.,0,0
33138,,,Multi-Label Prototype Visual Spatial Search for Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation,Existing Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation (WSSS) relies on the CNN-based Class Activation Map (CAM) and Transformer-based self-attention map to generate class-specific masks for semantic segmentation. However## CAM and self-attention maps usually cause incomplete segmentation due to classification bias issue. To address this issue## we propose a Multi-Label Prototype Visual Spatial Search (MuP-VSS) method with a spatial query mechanism## which learns a set of learnable class token vectors as queries to search the similarity visual tokens from image patch tokens. Specifically## MuP-VSS consists of two key components: multi-label prototype representation and multi-label prototype optimization. The former designs a global embedding to learn the global tokens from the images## and then proposes a Prototype Embedding Module (PEM) to interact with patch tokens to understand the local semantic information. The latter utilizes the exclusivity and consistency principles of the multi-label prototypes to design three prototype losses to optimize them## which contain cross-class prototype (CCP) contrastive loss## cross-image prototype (CIP) contrastive loss## and patch-to-prototype (P2P) consistency loss. CCP loss models exclusivity of multi-label prototypes learned from a single image to enhance the discriminative properties of each class better. CCP loss learns the consistency of the same class-specific prototypes extracted from multiple images to enhance the semantic consistency. P2P loss is proposed to control the semantic response of the prototype to the image patches. Experimental results on Pascal VOC 2012 and MS COCO show that MuP-VSS significantly outperforms recent methods and achieves state-of-the-art performance.,0,0

To overcome this problem## we develop a new pipeline## named Murre## for multi-view geometry reconstruction of 3D scenes based on SfM-guided monocular depth estimation. For input images## Murre first recover the SfM point cloud that captures the global scene structure## and then use it to guide a conditional diffusion model to produce multi-view metric depth maps for the final TSDF fusion. By predicting the depth map from a single image## Murre bypasses the multi-view matching step and naturally resolves the issues of previous MVS-based methods. In addition## the diffusion-based model can easily leverage the powerful priors of 2D foundation models## achieving good generalization ability across diverse real-world scenes. To obtain multi-view consistent depth maps## our key design is providing effective guidance on the diffusion model through the SfM point cloud## which is a condensed form of multi-view information## highlighting the scene's salient structure## and can be readily transformed into point maps to drive the image-space estimation process.

33882,,2403.16848,Multiple Object Tracking as ID Prediction,Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) has been a long-standing challenge in video understanding. A natural and intuitive approach is to split this task into two parts: object detection and association. Most mainstream methods employ meticulously crafted heuristic techniques to maintain trajectory information and compute cost matrices for object matching. Although these methods can achieve notable tracking performance## they often require a series of elaborate handcrafted modifications while facing complicated scenarios. We believe that manually assumed priors limit the method's adaptability and flexibility in learning optimal tracking capabilities from domain-specific data. Therefore## we introduce a new perspective that treats Multiple Object Tracking as an in-context ID Prediction task## transforming the aforementioned object association into an end-to-end trainable task. Based on this## we propose a simple yet effective method termed MOTIP. Given a set of trajectories carried with ID information## MOTIP directly decodes the ID labels for current detections to accomplish the association process. Without using tailored or sophisticated architectures## our method achieves state-of-the-art results across multiple benchmarks by solely leveraging object-level features as tracking cues. The simplicity and impressive results of MOTIP leave substantial room for future advancements## thereby making it a promising baseline for subsequent research.

34029,,2503.05657,NoT: Federated Unlearning via Weight Negation,Federated unlearning (FU) aims to remove a participant's data contributions from a trained federated learning (FL) model## ensuring privacy and regulatory compliance. Traditional FU methods often depend on auxiliary storage on either the client or server side or require direct access to the data targeted for removal--a dependency that may not be feasible if the data is no longer available. To overcome these limitations## we propose NoT## a novel and efficient FU algorithm based on weight negation (multiplying by -1)## which circumvents the need for additional storage and access to the target data.

33492,,,OVO-Bench: How Far is Your Video-LLMs from Real-World Online Video Understanding?,Temporal Awareness## the ability to reason dynamically based on the timestamp when a question is raised## is the key distinction between offline and online video LLMs. Unlike offline models## which rely on complete videos for static## post hoc analysis## online models process video streams incrementally and dynamically adapt their responses based on the timestamp at which the question is posed. Despite its significance## temporal awareness has not been adequately evaluated in existing benchmarks. To fill this gap## we present OVO-Bench (Online-VideO-Benchmark)## a novel video benchmark that emphasizes the importance of timestamps for advanced online video understanding capability benchmarking. OVO-Bench evaluates the ability of video LLMs to reason and respond to events occurring at specific timestamps under three distinct scenarios: (1) Backward tracing: trace back to past events to answer the question. (2) Real-time understanding: understand and respond to events as they unfold at the current timestamp. (3) Forward active responding: delay the response until sufficient future information becomes available to answer the question accurately. OVO-Bench comprises 12 tasks## featuring 644 unique videos and approximately human-curated 2##800 fine-grained meta-annotations with precise timestamps. We combine automated generation pipelines with human curation. With these high-quality samples## we further developed an evaluation pipeline to systematically query video LLMs along the video timeline. Evaluations of nine Video-LLMs reveal that## despite advancements on traditional benchmarks## current models struggle with online video understanding## showing a significant gap compared to human agents. We hope OVO-Bench will drive progress in video LLMs and inspire future research in online video reasoning. Our benchmark and code can be accessed at https://joeleelyf.github.io/OVO-Bench.,0,0

Open World Object Detection (OWOD) and Open Vocabulary Object Detection (OVD) are two main research directions## each addressing unique challenges in dynamic environments. However## existing studies often focus on only one of these tasks## leaving the combined challenges of OWOD and OVD largely underexplored. In this paper## we propose a novel detector## OW-OVD## which inherits the zero-shot generalization capability of OVD detectors while incorporating the ability to actively detect unknown objects and progressively optimize performance through incremental learning## as seen in OWOD detectors. To achieve this## we start with a standard OVD detector and adapt it for OWOD tasks. For attribute selection## we propose the Visual Similarity Attribute Selection (VSAS) method## which identifies the most generalizable attributes by computing similarity distributions across annotated and unannotated regions. Additionally## to ensure the diversity of attributes## we incorporate a similarity constraint in the iterative process. Finally## to preserve the standard inference process of OVD## we propose the Hybrid Attribute-Uncertainty Fusion (HAUF) method. This method combines attribute similarity with known class uncertainty to infer the likelihood of an object belonging to an unknown class. We validated the effectiveness of OW-OVD through evaluations on two OWOD benchmarks## M-OWODB and S-OWODB. The results demonstrate that OW-OVD outperforms existing state-of-the-art models## achieving a +15.3 improvement in unknown object recall (U-Recall) and a +15.5 increase in unknown class average precision (U-mAP).

34857,,,Omni-Scene: Omni-Gaussian Representation for Ego-Centric Sparse-View Scene Reconstruction,Prior works employing pixel-based Gaussian representation have demonstrated efficacy in feed-forward sparse-view reconstruction. However## such representation necessitates cross-view overlap for accurate depth estimation## and is challenged by object occlusions and frustum truncations. As a result## these methods require scene-centric data acquisition to maintain cross-view overlap and complete scene visibility to circumvent occlusions and truncations## which limits their applicability to scene-centric reconstruction.

Although omnidirectional images are becoming more popular since they reduce the computation required for image stitching to composite a holistic scene## existing feed-forward models are only designed for perspective images.

33337,,2505.18582,On Denoising Walking Videos for Gait Recognition,To capture individual gait patterns## excluding identity-irrelevant cues in walking videos## such as clothing texture and color## remains a persistent challenge for vision-based gait recognition. Traditional silhouette and pose-based methods## though theoretically effective at removing such distractions## often fall short of high accuracy due to their sparse and less informative inputs. To address this## emerging end-to-end methods focus on directly denoising RGB videos using global optimization and human-defined priors. Building on this trend## we propose a novel gait denoising method## DenosingGait. Inspired by the philosophy that 'what I cannot create## I do not understand'##  we turn to generative diffusion models## uncovering how these models can partially filter out irrelevant factors for improved gait understanding. Based on this generation-driven denoising## we introduce feature matching## a kind of popular geometrical constraint in optical flow and depth estimation## to compact multi-channel float-encoded RGB information into two-channel direction vectors that represent local structural features## where within-frame matching captures spatial details and cross-frame matching conveys temporal dynamics. Experiments on the CCPG## CAISA-B*## and SUSTech1K datasets demonstrate that DenoisingGait achieves a new SoTA performance in most cases for both within-domain and cross-domain evaluations.

Yet## such temporal comprehension capabilities are neither well-studied nor understood. So we conduct a study on prediction consistency -- a key indicator for robustness and trustworthiness of temporal grounding. After the model identifies an initial moment within the video content## we apply a series of probes to check if the model's responses align with this initial grounding as an indicator of reliable comprehension. Our results reveal that current Video-LLMs are sensitive to variations in video contents## language queries## and task settings## unveiling severe deficiencies in maintaining consistency.

33819,,,Once-Tuning-Multiple-Variants: Tuning Once and Expanded as Multiple Vision-Language Model Variants,Vision-language model (VLM) is one of the most important models for multi-modal tasks. Real industrial applications often meet the challenge of adapting VLMs to different scenarios## such as varying hardware platforms or performance requirements. Traditional methods involve training or fine-tuning to adapt multiple unique VLMs or using model compression techniques to create multiple compact models. These approaches are complex and resource-intensive. This paper introduces a novel paradigm called Once-Tuning-Multiple-Variants (OTMV). OTMV requires only a single tuning process to inject dynamic weight expansion capacity into the VLM with dynamic expansion capacity. This tuned VLM can then be expanded into multiple variants tailored for different scenarios in inference. The tuning mechanism of OTMV is inspired by the mathematical series expansion theorem## which helps to reduce the parameter size and memory requirements while maintaining accuracy for VLM. Experiment results show that OTMV-tuned models achieve comparable accuracy to baseline VLMs across various visual-language tasks. The experiments also demonstrate the dynamic expansion capability of OTMV-tuned VLMs## outperforming traditional model compression and adaptation techniques in terms of accuracy and efficiency.,0,0

34546,,2411.16799,One is Plenty: A Polymorphic Feature Interpreter for Immutable Heterogeneous Collaborative Perception,Collaborative perception in autonomous driving significantly enhances the perception capabilities of individual agents. Immutable heterogeneity in collaborative perception## where agents have different and fixed perception networks## presents a major challenge due to the semantic gap in their exchanged intermediate features without modifying the perception networks. Most existing methods bridge the semantic gap through interpreters. However## they either require training a new interpreter for each new agent type## limiting extensibility## or rely on a two-stage interpretation via an intermediate standardized semantic space## causing cumulative semantic loss. To achieve both extensibility in immutable heterogeneous scenarios and low-loss feature interpretation## we propose PolyInter## a polymorphic feature interpreter. It contains an extension point through which emerging new agents can seamlessly integrate by overriding only their specific prompts## which are learnable parameters intended to guide the interpretation## while reusing PolyInter's remaining parameters. By leveraging polymorphism## our design ensures that single interpreter is sufficient to accommodate diverse agents and interpret their features into the ego agent's semantic space. Experiments conducted on OPV2V dataset demonstrate that PolyInter improves collaborative perception precision by up to 11.1% compared to SOTA interpreters## while comparable results can be achieved by training only 1.4% of PolyInter's parameters when adapting to new agents.,0,0

Alternatives such as Mamba layers struggle to produce coherent scenes because their hidden states are small and less expressive. We experiment with Test-Time Training (TTT) layers## whose hidden states themselves can be neural networks## therefore larger and more expressive. Adding TTT layers into a pre-trained Transformer enables it to generate one-minute videos from text storyboards. We curate a dataset based on Tom and Jerry cartoons as a proof-of-concept benchmark.

34384,,,One-for-More: Continual Diffusion Model for Anomaly Detection,With the rise of generative models## there is a growing interest in unifying all tasks within a generative framework. Anomaly detection methods also fall into this scope and utilize diffusion models to generate or reconstruct normal samples when given arbitrary anomaly images. However## our study found that the diffusion model suffers from severe faithfulness hallucination and catastrophic forgetting## which can't meet the unpredictable pattern increments. To mitigate the above problems## we propose a continual diffusion model that uses gradient projection to achieve stable continual learning. Gradient projection deploys a regularization on the model updating by modifying the gradient towards the direction protecting the learned knowledge. But as a double-edged sword## it also requires huge memory costs brought by the Markov process. Hence## we propose an iterative singular value decomposition method based on the transitive property of linear representation## which consumes tiny memory and incurs almost no performance loss. Finally## considering the risk of over-fitting to normal images of the diffusion model## we propose an anomaly-masked network to enhance the condition mechanism of the diffusion model.

We show that pulsed lasers## despite being weak and fluctuating at MHz to GHz frequencies## leave a distinctive sinc comb pattern in the temporal frequency domain of incident flux that is specific to each laser and invariant to the scene. This enables their passive detection and analysis with a free-running SPAD camera## even when they are unknown## asynchronous## out of sight## and emitting concurrently. We show how to synchronize with such lasers computationally## characterize their pulse emissions## separate their contributions## and--if many are present--localize them in 3D and recover a depth map of the camera's field of view. We use our camera prototype to demonstrate (1) a first-of-its-kind visualization of asynchronously propagating light pulses from multiple lasers through the same scene## (2) passive estimation of a laser's MHz-scale pulse repetition frequency with mHz precision## and (3) mm-scale 3D imaging over room-scale distances by passively harvesting photons from two or more out-of-view lasers.,0,0

34146,,,OpticalNet: An Optical Imaging Dataset and Benchmark Beyond the Diffraction Limit,Optical imaging capable of resolving nanoscale features would revolutionize scientific research and engineering applications across biomedicine## smart manufacturing## and semiconductor quality control. However## due to the physical phenomenon of diffraction## the optical resolution is limited to approximately half the wavelength of light## which impedes the observation of subwavelength objects such as the native state coronavirus## typically smaller than 200 nm. Fortunately## deep learning methods have shown remarkable potential in uncovering underlying patterns within data## promising to overcome the diffraction limit by revealing the mapping pattern between diffraction images and their corresponding ground truth object images. However## the absence of suitable datasets has hindered progress in this field--collecting high-quality optical data of subwavelength objects is highly difficult as these objects are inherently invisible under conventional microscopy## making it impossible to perform standard visual calibration and drift correction. Therefore## we provide the first general optical imaging dataset based on the 'building block' concept for challenging the diffraction limit. Drawing an analogy to modular construction principles## we construct a comprehensive optical imaging dataset comprising subwavelength fundamental elements## i.e.## small square units that can be assembled into larger and more complex objects. We then frame the task as an image-to-image translation task and evaluate various vision methods. Experimental results validate our 'building block' concept## demonstrating that models trained on basic square units can effectively generalize to realistic## more complex unseen objects. Most importantly## by highlighting this underexplored AI-for-science area and its potential## we aspire to advance optical science by fostering collaboration with the vision and machine learning communities.,0,0

33199,,2504.07758,PIDSR: Complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution,Polarization cameras can capture multiple polarized images with different polarizer angles in a single shot## bringing convenience to polarization-based downstream tasks. However## their direct outputs are color-polarization filter array (CPFA) raw images## requiring demosaicing to reconstruct full-resolution## full-color polarized images; unfortunately## this necessary step introduces artifacts that make polarization-related parameters such as the degree of polarization (DoP) and angle of polarization (AoP) prone to error. Besides## limited by the hardware design## the resolution of a polarization camera is often much lower than that of a conventional RGB camera. Existing polarized image demosaicing (PID) methods are limited in that they cannot enhance resolution## while polarized image super-resolution (PISR) methods## though designed to obtain high-resolution (HR) polarized images from the demosaicing results## tend to retain or even amplify errors in the DoP and AoP introduced by demosaicing artifacts. In this paper## we propose PIDSR## a joint framework that performs complementary Polarized Image Demosaicing and Super-Resolution## showing the ability to robustly obtain high-quality HR polarized images with more accurate DoP and AoP from a CPFA raw image in a direct manner.

33794,,,PLeaS - Merging Models with Permutations and Least Squares,The democratization of machine learning systems has made the process of fine-tuning accessible to practitioners## leading to a wide range of open-source models fine-tuned on specialized tasks and datasets. Recent work has proposed to merge such models to combine their functionalities. However## prior approaches are usually restricted to models that are fine-tuned from the same base model. Furthermore## the final merged model is typically required to be of the same size as the original models. In this work## we propose a new two-step algorithm to merge models---termed PLeaS---which relaxes these constraints.First## leveraging the Permutation symmetries inherent in the two models## PLeaS partially matches nodes in each layer by maximizing alignment. Next## PLeaS computes the weights of the merged model as a layer-wise Least Squares solution to minimize the approximation error between the features of the merged model and the permuted features of the original models. PLeaS allows a practitioner to merge two models sharing the same architecture into a single performant model of a desired size## even when the two original models are fine-tuned from different base models. We also demonstrate how our method can be extended to address a challenging scenario where no data is available from the fine-tuning domains. We demonstrate our method to merge ResNet and ViT models trained with shared and different label spaces## and show improvement over the state-of-the-art merging methods  of up to 15 percentage points for the same target compute while merging models trained on DomainNet and fine-grained classification tasks.,0,0
33361,,2505.20941,PMA: Towards Parameter-Efficient Point Cloud Understanding via Point Mamba Adapter,Applying pre-trained models to assist point cloud understanding has recently become a mainstream paradigm in 3D perception. However## existing application strategies are straightforward## utilizing only the final output of the pre-trained model for various task heads. It neglects the rich complementary information in the intermediate layer## thereby failing to fully unlock the potential of pre-trained models. To overcome this limitation## we propose an orthogonal solution: Point Mamba Adapter (PMA)## which constructs an ordered feature sequence from all layers of the pre-trained model and leverages Mamba to fuse all complementary semantics## thereby promoting comprehensive point cloud understanding. Constructing this ordered sequence is non-trivial due to the inherent isotropy of 3D space. Therefore## we further propose a geometry-constrained gate prompt generator (G2PG) shared across different layers## which applies shared geometric constraints to the output gates of the Mamba and dynamically optimizes the spatial order## thus enabling more effective integration of multi-layer information. Extensive experiments conducted on challenging point cloud datasets across various tasks demonstrate that our PMA elevates the capability for point cloud understanding to a new level by fusing diverse complementary intermediate features.

In this paper## we present POMP ('\underline P hysics-c\underline O nsistent Human \underline M otion \underline P rior through Phase Manifolds')## a novel kinematics-based framework that synthesizes physically consistent motions by leveraging phase manifolds to align motion priors with physics constraints. POMP operates as a frame-by-frame autoregressive model with three core components: a diffusion-based kinematic module## a simulation-based dynamic module## and a phase encoding module.

34410,,2412.15119,Parallelized Autoregressive Visual Generation,Autoregressive models have emerged as a powerful approach for visual generation but suffer from slow inference speed due to their sequential token-by-token prediction process. In this paper## we propose a simple yet effective approach for parallelized autoregressive visual generation that improves generation efficiency while preserving the advantages of autoregressive modeling. Our key insight is that parallel generation depends on visual token dependencies: tokens with weak dependencies can be generated in parallel## while strongly dependent adjacent tokens are difficult to generate together## as their independent sampling may lead to inconsistencies. Based on this observation## we develop a parallel generation strategy that generates distant tokens with weak dependencies in parallel while maintaining sequential generation for strongly dependent local tokens. Our approach can be seamlessly integrated into standard autoregressive models without modifying the architecture or tokenizer.

In contrast## most applications and creative workflows require 3D assets to be composed of distinct## meaningful parts that can be independently manipulated. To bridge this gap## we introduce PartGen## a novel approach for generating## from text## images## or unstructured 3D objects## 3D objects composed of meaningful parts. Our method leverages a multi-view diffusion model to extract plausible and view-consistent part segmentations from multiple views of a 3D object## dividing it into meaningful components.

In this work## we present PatchDEMUX## a certifiably robust framework for multi-label classifiers against adversarial patches. Our approach is a generalizable method which can extend any existing certifiable defense for single-label classification; this is done by considering the multi-label classification task as a series of isolated binary classification problems to provably guarantee robustness. Furthermore## in the scenario where an attacker is limited to a single patch we propose an additional certification procedure that can provide tighter robustness bounds.

35016,,2412.03177,PatchDPO: Patch-level DPO for Finetuning-free Personalized Image Generation,Finetuning-free personalized image generation can synthesize customized images without test-time finetuning## attracting wide research interest owing to its high efficiency. Current finetuning-free methods simply adopt a single training stage with a simple image reconstruction task## and they typically generate low-quality images inconsistent with the reference images during test-time. To mitigate this problem## inspired by the recent DPO (i.e.## direct preference optimization) technique## this work proposes an additional training stage to improve the pre-trained personalized generation models. However## traditional DPO only determines the overall superiority or inferiority of two samples## which is not suitable for personalized image generation because the generated images are commonly inconsistent with the reference images only in some local image patches. To tackle this problem## this work proposes PatchDPO that estimates the quality of image patches within each generated image and accordingly trains the model. To this end## PatchDPO first leverages the pre-trained vision models with a proposed self-supervised training method to estimate the patch quality. Next## PatchDPO adopts a weighted training approach to train the model with the estimated patch quality## which rewards the image patches with high quality while penalizing the image patches with low quality. Experiment results demonstrate that PatchDPO significantly improves the performance of multiple pre-trained personalized generation models## and achieves state-of-the-art performance on both single-object and multi-object personalized image generation.

To overcome these limitations## we make the first exploration into utilizing video diffusion priors for patch-wise VSR.This is non-trivial because pre-trained video diffusion models are not native for patch-level detail generation. To mitigate this challenge## we propose an innovative approach## called PatchVSR## which integrates a dual-stream adapter for conditional guidance. The patch branch extracts features from input patches to maintain content fidelity while the global branch extracts context features from the resized full video to bridge the generation gap caused byincomplete semantics of patches.Particularly## we also inject the patch's location information into the model to better contextualize patch synthesis within the global video frame.Experiments demonstrate that our method can synthesize high-fidelity## high-resolution details at the patch level.

Towards ODU-OD## it is feasible to learn a robust discriminative boundary by synthesizing virtual features. Generally## perception## memory## and imagination are three essential capacities for human beings.

33465,,2412.03548,Perception Tokens Enhance Visual Reasoning in Multimodal Language Models,Multimodal language models (MLMs) still face challenges in fundamental visual perception tasks where specialized models excel. Tasks requiring reasoning about 3D structures benefit from depth estimation## and reasoning about 2D object instances benefits from object detection. Yet## MLMs can not produce intermediate depth or boxes to reason over. Finetuning MLMs on relevant data doesn't generalize well and outsourcing computation to specialized vision tools is too compute-intensive and memory-inefficient. To address this## we introduce Perception Tokens## intrinsic image representations designed to assist reasoning tasks where language is insufficient. Perception tokens act as auxiliary reasoning tokens## akin to chain-of-thought prompts in language models. For example## in a depth-related task## an MLM augmented with perception tokens can reason by generating a depth map as tokens## enabling it to solve the problem effectively. We propose AURORA## a training method that augments MLMs with perception tokens for improved reasoning over visual inputs. AUROA leverages a VQVAE to transform intermediate image representations## such as depth maps into a tokenized format and bounding box tokens## which is then used in a multi-task training framework. AURORA achieves notable improvements across counting benchmarks: +10.8% on BLINK## +11.3% on CVBench## and +8.3% on SEED-Bench## outperforming finetuning approaches in generalization across datasets. It also improves on relative depth: over +6% on BLINK.

34427,,,Perceptual Video Compression with Neural Wrapping,Standard video codecs are rate-distortion optimization machines## where distortion is typically quantified using PSNR versus the source. However## it is now widely accepted that increasing PSNR does not necessarily translate to better visual quality. In this paper## a better balance between perception and fidelity is targeted## in order to provide for significant rate savings over state-of-the-art standards-based video codecs. Specifically## pre- and postprocessing neural networks are proposed that enhance the coding efficiency of standard video codecs when benchmarked with an array of well-established perceptual quality scores. These 'neural wrapper' elements are end-to-end trained with a neural codec module serving as a differentiable proxy for standard video codecs. The codec proxy is jointly optimized with the pre- and post components## via a novel two-phase pretraining strategy and end-to-end iterative refinement with stop-gradient. This allows the neural pre- and postprocessor to learn to embed## remove and recover information in a codec-aware manner## thus improving its rate-quality performance. A single neural-wrapper model is thereby established and used for the entire rate-quality curve without needing any downscaling or upscaling. The trained model is tested with the AV1 and VVC standard codecs via an array of well-established objective quality scores (SSIM## MS-SSIM## VMAF## AVQT)## as well as mean opinion scores (MOS) derived from ITU-T P.910 subjective testing. Experimental results show that the proposed approach improves all quality scores## with -18.5% average Bjontegaard Delta-rate (BD-rate) saving over all objective scores and MOS improvement over both standard codecs.

Like other surveillance technologies## Re-ID faces serious privacy challenges## particularly the potential for unauthorized tracking. Although various tasks (e.g.## face recognition) have developed machine unlearning techniques to address privacy concerns## such methods have not yet been explored within the Re-ID field. In this work## we pioneer the exploration of the person de-reidentification (De-ReID) problem and present its inherent challenges. In the context of ReID## De-ReID is to unlearn the knowledge about accurately matching specific persons so that these 'unlearned persons' cannot be re-identified across cameras for privacy guarantee. The primary challenge is to achieve the unlearning without degrading the identity-discriminative feature embeddings to ensure the model's utility. To address this## we formulate a De-ReID framework that utilizes a labeled dataset of unlearned persons for unlearning and an unlabeled dataset of accessible persons for knowledge preservation. Instead of unlearning based on (pseudo) identity labels## we introduce a variation-guided identity shift mechanism that unlearns the specific persons by fitting the variations in their images while preserving ReID ability on other persons by overcoming the variations in images of accessible persons. As a result## the model shifts the unlearned persons to a feature space that is vulnerable to cross-view variations.

Conditioning on user embeddings## the text-to-image models are fine-tuned with the DPO objective## simultaneously optimizing for alignment with the preferences of multiple users. Empirical results demonstrate that our method effectively optimizes for multiple reward functions and can interpolate between them during inference.

Depending on what to ask (objects## attributes## sentiment## etc.) and how the questions are asked## we structure PhD along two dimensions## i.e. task and mode. Five visual recognition tasks## ranging from low-level (object / attribute recognition) to middle-level (sentiment / position recognition and counting)## are considered. Besides a normal visual QA mode## which we term PhD-base## PhD also asks questions with specious context (PhD-sec) or with incorrect context (PhD-icc)## or with AI-generated counter common sense images (PhD-ccs). We construct PhD by a ChatGPT-assisted semi-automated pipeline## encompassing four pivotal modules: task-specific hallucinatory item (hitem) selection## hitem-embedded question generation## specious / incorrect context generation## and counter-common-sense (CCS) image generation. With over 14k daily images## 750 CCS images and 102k VQA triplets in total## PhD reveals considerable variability in MLLMs' performance across various modes and tasks## offering valuable insights into the nature of hallucination. As such## PhD stands as a potent tool not only for VHE but may also play a significant role in the refinement of MLLMs.,0,0

Despite advancements in Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) that empower robots with semantic reflection ability for failure## translating semantic reflection into how to correct fine-grained robotic actions remains a significant challenge.

While state-of-the-art vision-language models (VLMs) excel in environmental perception## they often generate inaccurate or impractical responses in embodied visual reasoning tasks due to a lack of understanding of robotic physical reachability. To address this issue## we propose a unified representation of physical reachability across diverse robots## i.e.## Space-Physical Reachability Map (S-P Map)## and PhysVLM## a vision-language model that integrates this reachability information into visual reasoning.

34216,,,PillarHist: A Quantization-aware Pillar Feature Encoder based on Height-aware Histogram,Real-time and high-performance 3D object detection plays a critical role in autonomous driving and robotics. Recent pillar-based 3D object detectors have gained significant attention due to their compact representation and low computational overhead## making them suitable for onboard deployment and quantization. However## existing pillar-based detectors still suffer from information loss along height dimension and large numerical distribution difference during pillar feature encoding (PFE)## which severely limits their performance and quantization potential.

33357,,,Pixel-level and Semantic-level Adjustable Super-resolution: A Dual-LoRA Approach,Diffusion prior-based methods have shown impressive results in real-world image super-resolution (SR). However## most existing methods entangle pixel-level and semantic-level SR objectives in the training process## struggling to balance pixel-wise fidelity and perceptual quality. Meanwhile## users have varying preferences on SR results## thus it is demanded to develop an adjustable SR model that can be tailored to different fidelity-perception preferences during inference without re-training. We present Pixel-level and Semantic-level Adjustable SR (PiSA-SR)## which learns two LoRA modules upon the pre-trained stable-diffusion (SD) model to achieve improved and adjustable SR results. We first formulate the SD-based SR problem as learning the residual between the low-quality input and the high-quality output## then show that the learning objective can be decoupled into two distinct LoRA weight spaces: one is characterized by the l2-loss for pixel-level regression## and another is characterized by the LPIPS and classifier score distillation losses to extract semantic information from pre-trained classification and SD models.  In its default setting## PiSA-SR can be performed in a single diffusion step## achieving leading real-world SR results in both quality and efficiency. By introducing two adjustable guidance scales on the two LoRA modules to control the strengths of pixel-wise fidelity and semantic-level details during inference## PiSA-SR can offer flexible SR results according to user preference without re-training.

34727,,2503.20823,Playing the Fool: Jailbreaking LLMs and Multimodal LLMs with Out-of-Distribution Strategy,Despite the remarkable versatility of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Multimodal LLMs (MLLMs) to generalize across both language and vision tasks## LLMs and MLLMs have shown vulnerability to jailbreaking## generating textual outputs that undermine safety## ethical## and bias standards when exposed to harmful or sensitive inputs. With the recent advancement of safety alignment via preference-tuning from human feedback## LLMs and MLLMs have been equipped with safety guardrails to yield safe## ethical## and fair responses with regard to harmful inputs. However## despite the significance of safety alignment## research on the vulnerabilities remains largely underexplored. In this paper## we investigate the unexplored vulnerability of the safety alignment## examining its ability to consistently provide safety guarantees for out-of-distribution(OOD)-ifying harmful inputs that may fall outside the aligned data distribution. Our key observation is that OOD-ifying the vanilla harmful inputs highly increases the uncertainty of the model to discern the malicious intent within the input## leading to a higher chance of being jailbroken. Exploiting this vulnerability## we propose JOOD## a new Jailbreak framework via OOD-ifying inputs beyond the safety alignment. We explore various off-the-shelf visual and textual transformation techniques for OOD-ifying the harmful inputs. Notably## we observe that even simple mixing-based techniques such as image mixup prove highly effective in increasing the uncertainty of the model## thereby facilitating the bypass of the safety alignment. Experiments across diverse jailbreak scenarios demonstrate that JOOD effectively jailbreaks recent proprietary LLMs and MLLMs such as GPT-4 and o1 with high attack success rate## which previous attack approaches have consistently struggled to jailbreak.

However## these methods  remain bounded to handling the facets of responsibility concepts individually## while also lacking in interpretability. Moreover##  they often require alteration to the original model## which compromises the model performance. In this work## we propose a unique technique to enable  responsible T2I generation by simultaneously accounting for an  extensive range of concepts for fair and safe content generation in a scalable manner. The key idea is to distill the target T2I pipeline with an external plug-and-play mechanism that learns an interpretable composite responsible space for the desired concepts## conditioned on the target T2I pipeline. We use knowledge distillation and concept whitening to enable this. At inference## the learned space is utilized to modulate the generative content. A typical T2I pipeline presents two plug-in points for our approach## namely; the text embedding space and the diffusion model latent space.

Existing methods mostly focus on generating the geometric details of point clouds## neglecting noise suppression. To address this## we propose a novel network based on a conditional diffusion model## incorporating the Adaptive Noise Suppression (ANS) module## which we refer to as PDANS. The ANS module assigns weights to each point and determines the removal strategy based on these weights## reducing the impact of noisy points on the sampling process. The module first selects the neighborhood set for each point in the point cloud and performs a weighted sum between the point and its neighbors. It then adjusts the removal points based on the weighted sum## effectively mitigating the bias caused by outliers. We introduce the TreeTrans (TT) module to capture more correlated feature information. This module learns the interaction between high-level and low-level features## resulting in a more comprehensive and refined feature representation.

33432,,2505.21943,Point-to-Region Loss for Semi-Supervised Point-Based Crowd Counting,Point detection has been developed to locate pedestrians in crowded scenes by training a counter through a point-to-point (P2P) supervision scheme. Despite its excellent localization and counting performance## training a point-based counter still faces challenges concerning annotation labor: hundreds to thousands of points are required to annotate a single sample capturing a dense crowd. In this paper## we integrate point-based methods into a semi-supervised counting framework based on pseudo-labeling## enabling the training of a counter with only a few annotated samples supplemented by a large volume of pseudo-labeled data. However## during implementation## the training encounters issues as the confidence for pseudo-labels fails to be propagated to background pixels via the P2P. To tackle this challenge## we devise a point-specific activation map (PSAM) to visually interpret the phenomena occurring during the ill-posed training. Observations from the PSAM suggest that the feature map is excessively activated by the loss for unlabeled data## causing the decoder to misinterpret these over-activations as pedestrians. To mitigate this issue## we propose a point-to-region (P2R) scheme to substitute P2P## which segments out local regions rather than detects a point corresponding to a pedestrian for supervision. Consequently## pixels in the local region can share the same confidence with the corresponding pseudo points. Experimental results in both semi-supervised counting and unsupervised domain adaptation highlight the advantages of our method## illustrating P2R can resolve issues identified in PSAM.

32901,,,PolarNeXt: Rethink Instance Segmentation with Polar Representation,One of the roadblocks for instance segmentation today is heavy computational overhead and model parameters. Previous methods based on Polar Representation made the initial mark to address this challenge by formulating instance segmentation as polygon detection## but failed to align with mainstream methods in performance. In this paper## we highlight that Representation Errors## arising from the limited capacity of polygons to capture boundary details## have long been overlooked## which results in severe performance degradation. Observing that optimal starting point selection effectively alleviates this issue## we propose an Adaptive Polygonal Sample Decision strategy to dynamically capture the positional variation of representation errors across samples. Additionally## we design a Union-aligned Rasterization Module to incorporate these errors into polygonal assessment## further advancing the proposed strategy. With these components## our framework called PolarNeXt achieves a remarkable performance boost of over 4.8% AP compared to other polar-based methods. PolarNeXt is markedly more lightweight and efficient than state-of-the-art instance segmentation methods## while achieving comparable segmentation accuracy. We expect this work will open up a new direction for instance segmentation in high-resolution images and resource-limited scenarios.,0,0

34430,,,Poly-Autoregressive Prediction for Modeling Interactions,We introduce a simple framework for predicting the behavior of an agent in multi-agent settings. In contrast to autoregressive (AR) tasks## such as language processing## our focus is on scenarios with multiple agents whose interactions are shaped by physical constraints and internal motivations. To this end## we propose Poly-Autoregressive (PAR) modeling## which forecasts an ego agent's future behavior by reasoning about the ego agent's state history and the past and current states of other interacting agents. At its core## PAR represents the behavior of all agents as a sequence of tokens## each representing an agent's state at a specific timestep. With minimal data pre-processing changes## we show that PAR can be applied to three different problems: human action forecasting in social situations## trajectory prediction for autonomous vehicles## and object pose forecasting during hand-object interaction. Using a small proof-of-concept transformer backbone## PAR outperforms AR across these three scenarios.,0,0
35202,,,Population Normalization for Federated Learning,Batch normalization (BN) is widely recognized as an essential method in training deep neural networks## facilitating convergence and enhancing model stability. However## in Federated Learning (FL) contexts## where training data are typically heterogeneous and clients often face resource constraints## the effectiveness of BN is considerably limited for two primary reasons. First## the population statistics## specifically the mean and variance of these heterogeneous datasets## vary substantially## resulting in inconsistent BN layers across client models## which ultimately drives these models to diverge further. Second## estimating statistics from a mini-batch is often imprecise since the batch size has to be small in resource-limited clients. This paper introduces Population Normalization## a novel technique for FL## in which the statistics are learned as trainable parameters rather than calculated from mini-batches as in BN. Thus## our normalization layers are homogeneous among the clients and the adverse impact of small batch size is eliminated as the model can be well-trained even when the batch size equals to one. To enhance the flexibility of our method in practical applications## we investigate the role of stochastic uncertainty in BN's statistical estimation. When larger batch sizes are available## we demonstrate that injecting simple artificial noise can effectively mimic this stochastic uncertainty and improve the model's generalization capability. Experimental results validate the efficacy of our approach across various FL tasks.,0,0
35115,,,Pos3R: 6D Pose Estimation for Unseen Objects Made Easy,Foundation models have significantly reduced the need for task-specific training## while also enhancing generalizability.

32923,,,Pose-Guided Temporal Enhancement for Robust Low-Resolution Hand Reconstruction,3D hand reconstruction is essential in non-contact human-computer interaction applications## but existing methods struggle with low-resolution images## which occur in slightly distant interactive scenes. Leveraging temporal information can mitigate the limitations of individual low-resolution images that lack detailed appearance information## thereby enhancing the robustness and accuracy of hand reconstruction. Existing temporal methods typically use joint features to represent temporal information## avoiding interference from redundant background information. However## joint features excessively disregard the spatial context of visual features## limiting hand reconstruction accuracy. We propose to integrate temporal joint features with visual features to construct a robust low-resolution visual representation. We introduce Triplane Features## a dense representation with 3D spatial awareness## to bridge the gap between the joint features and visual features that are misaligned in terms of representation form and semantics. Triplane Features are obtained by orthogonally projecting the joint features## embedding hand structure information into the 3D spatial context. Furthermore## we compress the spatial information of the three planes into a 2D dense feature thourgh Spatial-Aware Fusion to enhance the visual features. By using enhanced visual features enriched with temporal information for hand reconstruction## our method achieves competitive performance at much lower resolutions compared to state-of-the-art methods operating at high resolution on DexYCB## HanCo and H2O.,0,0

RDC renoises the predicted denoised image by the predicted noise to construct multiple noisy images## preserving all the information of the original image. DCS ensures consistency across the multiple denoised images## supervising the network to learn robust denoising.

32768,,2504.12717,Post-pre-training for Modality Alignment in Vision-Language Foundation Models,Contrastive language image pre-training (CLIP) is an essential component of building modern vision-language foundation models. While CLIP demonstrates remarkable zero-shot performance on downstream tasks## the multi-modal feature spaces still suffer from a modality gap## which is a gap between image and text feature clusters and limits downstream task performance. Although existing works attempt to address the modality gap by modifying pre-training or fine-tuning## they struggle with heavy training costs with large datasets or degradations of zero-shot performance. This paper presents CLIP-Refine## a post-pre-training method for CLIP models at a phase between pre-training and fine-tuning. CLIP-Refine aims to align the feature space with 1 epoch training on small image-text datasets without zero-shot performance degradations. To this end## we introduce two techniques: random feature alignment (RaFA) and hybrid contrastive-distillation (HyCD). RaFA aligns the image and text features to follow a shared prior distribution by minimizing the distance to random reference vectors sampled from the prior. HyCD updates the model with hybrid soft labels generated by combining ground-truth image-text pair labels and outputs from the pre-trained CLIP model. This contributes to achieving both maintaining the past knowledge and learning new knowledge to align features. Our extensive experiments with multiple classification and retrieval tasks show that CLIP-Refine succeeds in mitigating the modality gap and improving the zero-shot performance.

34201,,2503.21694,Progressive Rendering Distillation: Adapting Stable Diffusion for Instant Text-to-Mesh Generation without 3D Data,It is highly desirable to obtain a model that can generate high-quality 3D meshes from text prompts in just seconds. While recent attempts have adapted pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models## such as Stable Diffusion (SD)## into generators of 3D representations (e.g.## Triplane)## they often suffer from poor quality due to the lack of sufficient high-quality 3D training data. Aiming at overcoming the data shortage## we propose a novel training scheme## termed as Progressive Rendering Distillation (PRD)## eliminating the need for 3D ground-truths by distilling multi-view diffusion models and adapting SD into a native 3D generator. In each iteration of training## PRD uses the U-Net to progressively denoise the latent from random noise for a few steps## and in each step it decodes the denoised latent into 3D output. Multi-view diffusion models## including MVDream and RichDreamer## are used in joint with SD to distill text-consistent textures and geometries into the 3D outputs through score distillation. Since PRD supports training without 3D ground-truths## we can easily scale up the training data and improve generation quality for challenging text prompts with creative concepts. Meanwhile## PRD can accelerate the inference speed of the generation model in just a few steps.  With PRD## we train a Triplane generator## namely TriplaneTurbo## which adds only 2.5% trainable parameters to adapt SD for Triplane generation.

Prompt-CAM learns class-specific prompts for a pre-trained ViT and uses the corresponding outputs for classification. To correctly classify an image## the true-class prompt must attend to unique image patches not present in other classes' images  (i.e.## traits). As a result## the true class's multi-head attention maps reveal traits and their locations. Implementation-wise## Prompt-CAM is almost a 'free lunch##' requiring only a modification to the prediction head of Visual Prompt Tuning (VPT). This makes Prompt-CAM easy to train and apply## in stark contrast to other interpretable methods that require designing specific models and training processes. Extensive empirical studies on a dozen datasets from various domains (e.g.## birds## fishes## insects## fungi## flowers## food## and cars) validate the superior interpretation capability of Prompt-CAM.

34468,,,RL-RC-DoT: A Block-level RL agent for Task-Aware Video Compression,Video encoders optimize compression for human perception by minimizing reconstruction error under bit-rate constraints. In many modern applications such as autonomous driving## an overwhelming majority of videos serve as input for AI systems performing tasks like object recognition or segmentation## rather than being watched by humans. It is therefore useful to optimize the encoder for a downstream task instead of for perceptual image quality. However## a major challenge is how to combine such downstream optimization with existing standard video encoders## which are highly efficient and popular. Here## we address this challenge by controlling the Quantization Parameters (QPs) at the macro-block level to optimize the downstream task. This granular control allows us to prioritize encoding for task-relevant regions within each frame. We formulate this optimization problem as a Reinforcement Learning (RL) task## where the agent learns to balance long-term implications of choosing QPs on both task performance and bit-rate constraints. Notably## our policy does not require the downstream task as an input during inference## making it suitable for streaming applications and edge devices such as vehicles. We demonstrate significant improvements in two tasks## car detection## and ROI (saliency) encoding. Our approach improves task performance for a given bit rate compared to traditional task agnostic encoding methods## paving the way for more efficient task-aware video compression.,0,0

34784,,,ROLL: Robust Noisy Pseudo-label Learning for Multi-View Clustering with Noisy Correspondence,Multi-view clustering (MVC) aims to exploit complementary information from diverse views to enhance clustering performance. Since pseudo-labels can provide additional semantic information## many MVC methods have been proposed to guide unsupervised multi-view learning through pseudo-labels.

33476,,2501.04440,RSAR: Restricted State Angle Resolver and Rotated SAR Benchmark,Rotated object detection has made significant progress in the optical remote sensing. However## advancements in the Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) field are laggard behind## primarily due to the absence of a large-scale dataset. Annotating such a dataset is inefficient and costly. A promising solution is to employ a weakly supervised model (e.g.## trained with available horizontal boxes only) to generate pseudo-rotated boxes for reference before manual calibration. Unfortunately## the existing weakly supervised models exhibit limited accuracy in predicting the object's angle. Previous works attempt to enhance angle prediction by using angle resolvers that decouple angles into cosine and sine encodings. In this work## we first reevaluate these resolvers from a unified perspective of dimension mapping and expose that they share the same shortcomings: these methods overlook the unit cycle constraint inherent in these encodings## easily leading to prediction biases. To address this issue## we propose the Unit Cycle Resolver (UCR)## which incorporates a unit circle constraint loss to improve angle prediction accuracy. Our approach can effectively improve the performance of existing state-of-the-art weakly supervised methods and even surpasses fully supervised models on existing optical benchmarks (i.e.## DOTA-v1.0).

To avoid this problem## we propose a query-based framework that enables adaptive sampling of instance-relevant features from both the bird's-eye view (BEV) and the original image view. Furthermore## we enhance system performance by two key designs: optimizing query initialization and strengthening the representational capacity of BEV. For the former## we introduce an adaptive circular distribution in polar coordinates to refine the initialization of object queries## allowing for a distance-based adjustment of query density. For the latter## we initially incorporate a radar-guided depth head to refine the transformation from image view to BEV. Subsequently## we focus on leveraging the Doppler effect of radar and introduce an implicit dynamic catcher to capture the temporal elements within the BEV. Extensive experiments on nuScenes and View-of-Delft (VoD) datasets validate the merits of our design. Remarkably## our method achieves superior results of 64.9% mAP and 70.2% NDS on nuScenes.

To address these challenges## we introduce ReWind## a novel two-stage framework for long video understanding. In the first stage## ReWind maintains a dynamic memory that stores and updates instruction-relevant visual information as the video unfolds.Memory updates leverage novel read and write mechanisms utilizing learnable queries and cross-attentions between memory contents and the input stream. This approach maintains low memory requirements as the cross-attention layers scale linearly w.r.t. number of tokens. In the second stage## the memory content guides the selection of a few relevant frames## represented at high spatial resolution## which are combined with the memory contents and fed into an LLM to generate the final answer.

However## they either struggle to capture pose-dependent appearance details with a single MLP## or rely on a computationally intensive neural network to reconstruct high-fidelity appearance but with rendering performance degraded to non-real-time. We propose a novel Gaussian human avatar representation that can reconstruct high-fidelity pose-dependence appearance with details and meanwhile can be rendered in real time. Our Gaussian avatar is empowered by spatially distributed MLPs which are explicitly located on different positions on human body. The parameters stored in each Gaussian are obtained by interpolating from the outputs of its nearby MLPs based on their distances. To avoid undesired smooth Gaussian property changing during interpolation## for each Gaussian we define a set of Gaussian offset basis## and a linear combination of basis represents the Gaussian property offsets relative to the neutral properties. Then we propose to let the MLPs output a set of coefficients corresponding to the basis. In this way## although Gaussian coefficients are derived from interpolation and change smoothly## the Gaussian offset basis is learned freely without constraints. The smoothly varying coefficients combined with freely learned basis can still produce distinctly different Gaussian property offsets## allowing the ability to learn high-frequency spatial signals. We further use control points to constrain the Gaussians distributed on a surface layer rather than allowing them to be irregularly distributed inside the body## to help the human avatar generalize better when animated under novel poses. Compared to the state-of-the-art method## our method achieves better appearance quality with finer details while the rendering speed is significantly faster under novel views and novel poses.,0,0

34686,,2503.15337,Recover and Match: Open-Vocabulary Multi-Label Recognition through Knowledge-Constrained Optimal Transport,Identifying multiple novel classes in an image## known as open-vocabulary multi-label recognition## is a challenging task in computer vision. Recent studies explore the transfer of powerful vision-language models such as CLIP. However## these approaches face two critical challenges: (1) The local semantics of CLIP are disrupted due to its global pre-training objectives## resulting in unreliable regional predictions. (2) The matching property between image regions and candidate labels has been neglected## relying instead on naive feature aggregation such as average pooling## which leads to spurious predictions from irrelevant regions. In this paper## we present RAM (Recover And Match)## a novel framework that effectively addresses the above issues. To tackle the first problem## we propose Ladder Local Adapter (LLA) to enforce the model to refocus on its surrounding local regions## recovering local semantics in a memory-friendly way. For the second issue## we propose Knowledge-Constrained Optimal Transport (KCOT) to suppress meaningless matching to non-GT labels by formulating the task as an optimal transport problem. As a result## RAM achieves state-of-the-art performance on various datasets from three distinct domains## and shows great potential to boost the existing methods.

To overcome this## we propose Liv3Stroke## a novel approach for abstracting objects in motion with deformable 3D strokes. The detailed movements of an object may be represented by unstructured motion vectors or a set of motion primitives using a pre-defined articulation from a template model. Just as a free-hand sketch can intuitively visualize scenes or intentions with a sparse set of lines## we utilize a set of parametric 3D curves to capture a set of spatially smooth motion elements for general objects with unknown structures. We first extract noisy## 3D point cloud motion guidance from video frames using semantic features## and our approach deforms a set of curves to abstract essential motion features as a set of explicit 3D representations. Such abstraction enables an understanding of prominent components of motions while maintaining robustness to environmental factors. Our approach allows direct analysis of 3D object movements from video## tackling the uncertainty that typically occurs when translating real-world motion into recorded footage.

32390,,,Rectification-specific Supervision and Constrained Estimator for Online Stereo Rectification,Online stereo rectification is critical for autonomous vehicles and robots in dynamic environments## where factors such as vibration## temperature fluctuations## and mechanical stress can affect rectification accuracy and severely degrade downstream stereo depth estimation. Current dominant approaches for online stereo rectification involve estimating relative camera poses in real time to derive rectification homographies. However## they do not directly optimize for rectification constraints. Additionally## the general-purpose correspondence matchers used in these methods are not trained for rectification## while training of these matchers typically requires ground-truth correspondences which are not available in stereo rectification datasets. To address these limitations## we propose a matching-based stereo rectification framework that is directly optimized for rectification and does not require ground-truth correspondence annotations for training. We assume intrinsics are known as they are generally available on modern devices and are relatively stable. Our framework incorporates a rectification-constrained estimator and applies multi-level## rectification-specific supervision that trains the matcher network for rectification without relying on ground-truth correspondences. Additionally## we create a new rectification dataset with ground-truth optical flow annotations## eliminating bias from evaluation metrics used in prior work that relied on pretrained keypoint matching or optical flow models. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms both state-of-the-art matching-based and matching-free methods in vertical flow metric by 10.7% on the Carla-Flowguided dataset and 21.3% on the Semi-Truck Highway dataset## offering superior rectification accuracy.,0,0
33303,,2410.18737,Rectified Diffusion Guidance for Conditional Generation,Classifier-Free Guidance (CFG)## which combines the conditional and unconditional score functions with two coefficients summing to one## serves as a practical technique for diffusion model sampling. Theoretically## however## denoising with CFG cannot be expressed as a reciprocal diffusion process## which may consequently leave some hidden risks during use. In this work## we revisit the theory behind CFG and rigorously confirm that the improper configuration of the combination coefficients (*i.e.*## the widely used summing-to-one version) brings about expectation shift of the generative distribution. To rectify this issue## we propose ReCFG with a relaxation on the guidance coefficients such that denoising with ReCFG strictly aligns with the diffusion theory. We further show that our approach enjoys a **closed-form** solution given the guidance strength. That way## the rectified coefficients can be readily pre-computed via traversing the observed data## leaving the sampling speed barely affected. Empirical evidence on real-world data demonstrate the compatibility of our post-hoc design with existing state-of-the-art diffusion models## including both class-conditioned ones (*e.g.*## EDM2 on ImageNet) and text-conditioned ones (*e.g.*## SD3 on CC12M)## without any retraining.

Existing methods generally extract support features via heatmap pooling## and obtain interacted features from support and query via cross-attention. Hence## these works neglect to mine fine-grained and structure-aware (FGSA) features from both support and query images## which are crucial for pixel-level keypoint localization. To this end## we propose a novel yet concise framework## which recurrently mines FGSA features from both support and query images. Specifically## we design a FGSA mining module based on deformable attention mechanism. On the one hand## we mine fine-grained features by applying deformable attention head over multi-scale feature maps. On the other hand## we mine structure-aware features by offsetting the reference points of keypoints to their linked keypoints. By means of above module## we recurrently mine FGSA features from support and query images## and thus obtain better support features and query estimations. In addition## we propose to use mixup keypoints to pad various classes to a unified keypoint number## which could provide richer supervision than the zero padding used in existing works. We conduct extensive experiments and in-depth studies on large-scale MP-100 dataset## and outperform SOTA method dramatically (+3.2% PCK\@0.05).,0,0
34533,,2410.24160,Redefining <Creative> in Dictionary: Towards an Enhanced Semantic Understanding of Creative Generation,Creative remains an inherently abstract concept for both humans and diffusion models. While text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models can easily generate out-of-distribution concepts like 'a blue banana'## they struggle with generating combinatorial objects such as 'a creative mixture that resembles a lettuce and a mantis'## due to difficulties in understanding the semantic depth of 'creative'. Current methods rely heavily on synthesizing reference prompts or images to achieve a creative effect## typically requiring retraining for each unique creative output-a process that is computationally intensive and limits practical applications. To address this## we introduce CreTok## which brings meta-creativity to diffusion models by redefining 'creative' as a new token## <CreTok>## thus enhancing models' semantic understanding for combinatorial creativity. CreTok achieves such redefinition by iteratively sampling diverse text pairs from our proposed CangJie dataset to form adaptive prompts and restrictive prompts## and then optimizing the similarity between their respective text embeddings. Extensive experiments demonstrate that <CreTok> enables the universal and direct generation of combinatorial creativity across diverse concepts without additional training## achieving state-of-the-art performance with improved text-image alignment and higher human preference ratings.

33541,,2503.17677,Reducing Class-wise Confusion for Incremental Learning with Disentangled Manifolds,Class incremental learning (CIL) aims to enable models to continuously learn new classes without catastrophically forgetting old ones. A promising direction is to learn and use prototypes of classes during incremental updates. Despite simplicity and intuition## we find that such methods suffer from inadequate representation capability and unsatisfied feature overlap. These two factors cause class-wise confusion and limited performance. In this paper## we develop a Confusion-REduced AuTo-Encoder classifier (CREATE) for CIL. Specifically## our method employs a lightweight auto-encoder module to learn compact manifold for each class in the latent subspace## constraining samples to be well reconstructed only on the semantically correct auto-encoder. Thus## the representation stability and capability of class distributions are enhanced## alleviating the potential class-wise confusion problem. To further distinguish the overlapped features## we propose a confusion-aware latent space separation loss that ensures samples are closely distributed in their corresponding low-dimensional manifold while keeping away from the distributions of drifted features from other classes. Our method demonstrates stronger representational capacity and discrimination ability by learning disentangled manifolds and reduces class confusion. Extensive experiments on multiple datasets and settings show that CREATE outperforms other state-of-the-art methods up to 5.41%.,0,0

To tackle this issue## we propose RefPose## an innovative approach to object pose estimation that leverages a reference image and geometric correspondence as guidance. RefPose first predicts an initial pose by using object templates to render the reference image and establish the geometric correspondence needed for the refinement stage. During the refinement stage## RefPose estimates the geometric correspondence of the query based on the generated references and iteratively refines the pose through a render-and-compare approach. To enhance this estimation## we introduce a correlation volume-guided attention mechanism that effectively captures correlations between the query and reference images. Unlike traditional methods that depend on pre-defined object models## RefPose dynamically adapts to new object shapes by leveraging a reference image and geometric correspondence. This results in robust performance across previously unseen objects. Extensive evaluation on the BOP benchmark datasets shows that RefPose achieves state-of-the-art results while maintaining a competitive runtime.,0,0

Existing works rely on direct matching for end-to-end lifting## yielding inferior results## or employ a two-stage solution constrained by complex pre- or post-processing. In this work## we design Unified-Lift## a new end-to-end object-aware lifting approach that aims for high-quality 3D segmentation based on our object-aware 3D Gaussian representation. To start## we augment each Gaussian point with a Gaussian-level feature learned using a contrastive loss to encode instance information. Importantly## we introduce a learnable object-level codebook to account for individual objects in the scene for an explicit object-level understanding and associate the encoded object-level features with the Gaussian-level point features for segmentation predictions. While promising## achieving effective codebook learning is nontrivial and a naive solution leads to degraded performance. Hence## we formulate the association learning module and the noisy label filtering module for effective and robust codebook learning. We conduct experiments on three benchmarks LERF-Masked## Replica## and Messy Rooms. Both qualitative and quantitative results manifest that our Unified-Lift clearly outperforms existing methods in terms of segmentation quality and time efficiency.,0,0
33978,,2502.19691,Rethinking Epistemic and Aleatoric Uncertainty for Active Open-Set Annotation: An Energy-Based Approach,Active learning (AL)## which iteratively queries the most informative examples from a large pool of unlabeled candidates for model training## faces significant challenges in the presence of open-set classes. Existing methods either prioritize query examples likely to belong to known classes## indicating low epistemic uncertainty (EU)## or focus on querying those with highly uncertain predictions## reflecting high aleatoric uncertainty (AU). However## they both yield suboptimal performance## as low EU corresponds to limited useful information## and closed-set AU metrics for unknown class examples are less meaningful. In this paper## we propose an Energy-based Active Open-set Annotation (EAOA) framework## which effectively integrates EU and AU to achieve superior performance. EAOA features a (C+1)-class detector and a target classifier## incorporating an energy-based EU measure and a margin-based energy loss designed for the detector## alongside an energy-based AU measure for the target classifier. Another crucial component is the target-driven adaptive sampling strategy. It first forms a smaller candidate set with low EU scores to ensure closed-set properties## making AU metrics meaningful. Subsequently## examples with high AU scores are queried to form the final query set## with the candidate set size adjusted adaptively. Extensive experiments show that EAOA achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining high query precision and low training overhead.

35059,,2503.11609,Rethinking Few-Shot Adaptation of Vision-Language Models in Two Stages,An old-school recipe for training a classifier is to (i) learn a good feature extractor and (ii) optimize a linear layer atop. When only a handful of samples are available per category## as in Few-Shot Adaptation (FSA)## data are insufficient to fit a large number of parameters## rendering the above impractical. This is especially true with large pre-trained Vision-Language Models (VLMs)## which motivated successful research at the intersection of Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) and FSA. In this work## we start by analyzing the learning dynamics of PEFT techniques when trained on few-shot data from only a subset of categories## referred to as the 'base' classes. We show that such dynamics naturally splits into two distinct phases: (i) task-level feature extraction and (ii) specialization to the available concepts. To accommodate this dynamic## we then depart from prompt- or adapter-based methods and tackle FSA differently. Specifically## given a fixed computational budget## we split it to (i) learn a task-specific feature extractor via PEFT and (ii) train a linear classifier on top. We call this scheme Two-Stage Few-Shot Adaptation (2SFS). Differently from established methods## our scheme enables a novel form of selective inference at a category level## i.e.## at test time## only novel categories are embedded by the adapted text encoder## while embeddings of base categories are available within the classifier. Results with fixed hyperparameters across two settings## three backbones## and eleven datasets## show that 2SFS matches or surpasses the state-of-the-art## while established methods degrade significantly across settings.,0,0
34167,,2503.06237,Rethinking Lanes and Points in Complex Scenarios for Monocular 3D Lane Detection,Monocular 3D lane detection is a fundamental task in autonomous driving. Although sparse-point methods lower computational load and maintain high accuracy in complex lane geometries## current methods fail to fully leverage the geometric structure of lanes in both lane geometry representations and model design. In lane geometry representations## we present a theoretical analysis alongside experimental validation to verify that current sparse lane representation methods contain inherent flaws## resulting in potential errors of up to 20 m## which raise significant safety concerns for driving. To address this issue## we propose a novel patching strategy to completely represent the full lane structure. To enable existing models to match this strategy## we introduce the EndPoint head (EP-head)## which adds a patching distance to endpoints. The EP-head enables the model to predict more complete lane representations even with fewer preset points## effectively addressing existing limitations and paving the way for models that are faster and require fewer parameters in the future. In model design## to enhance the model's perception of lane structures## we propose the PointLane attention (PL-attention)## which incorporates prior geometric knowledge into the attention mechanism.

While numerous VTR methods have achieved success## most of them assume accurate visual-text correspondences during training## which is difficult to ensure in practice due to ubiquitous noise## known as noisy correspondences (NC). In this paper## we rethink how to mitigate the NC from the perspective of representative reference features (termed agents)## and propose a novel relation-aware purified consistency (RPC) network to amend direct pairwise correlation## including representative agents construction and relation-aware ranking distribution alignment. The proposed RPC enjoys several merits. First## to learn the agents well without any correspondence supervision## we customize the agents construction according to the three characteristics of reliability## representativeness## and resilience.

With the surging demand for customization## PAA enables applications to generate personalized outcomes by aligning with individual aesthetic preferences. The prevailing PAA paradigm involves two stages: pre-training and fine-tuning## but it faces three inherent challenges: 1) The model is pre-trained using datasets of the Generic Aesthetics Assessment (GAA)## but the collective preferences of GAA lead to conflicts in individualized aesthetic predictions. 2) The scope and stage of personalized surveys are related to both the user and the assessed object; however## the prevailing personalized surveys fail to adequately address assessed objects' characteristics. 3) During application usage## the cumulative multimodal feedback from an individual holds great value that should be considered for improving the PAA model but unfortunately attracts insufficient attention. To address the aforementioned challenges## we introduce a new PAA paradigm called PAA+## which is structured into three distinct stages: pre-training## fine-tuning## and continual learning. Furthermore## to better reflect individual differences## we employ a familiar and intuitive application## physique aesthetics assessment (PhysiqueAA)## to validate the PAA+ paradigm.  We propose a dataset called PhysiqueAA50K## consisting of over 50##000 annotated physique images.

34538,,,Rethinking Query-based Transformer for Continual Image Segmentation,Class-incremental/Continual image segmentation (CIS) aims to train an image segmenter in stages## where the set of available categories differs at each stage. To leverage the built-in objectness of query-based transformers## which mitigates catastrophic forgetting of mask proposals## current methods often decouple mask generation from the continual learning process. This study## however## identifies two key issues with decoupled frameworks: loss of plasticity and heavy reliance on input data order. To address these## we conduct an in-depth investigation of the built-in objectness and find that highly aggregated image features provide a shortcut for queries to generate masks through simple feature alignment. Based on this## we propose SimCIS## a simple yet powerful baseline for CIS. Its core idea is to directly select image features for query assignment## ensuring 'perfect alignment' to preserve objectness## while simultaneously allowing queries to select new classes to promote plasticity. To further combat catastrophic forgetting of categories## we introduce cross-stage consistency in selection and an innovative 'visual query'-based replay mechanism. Experiments demonstrate that SimCIS consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across various segmentation tasks## settings## splits## and input data orders.

Once retrieved## we then inject these semantic exemplar gestures into our diffusion-based gesture generation pipeline using DDIM inversion and retrieval guidance at the inference time without any need of training. Further## we propose a control paradigm for guidance## that allows the users to modulate the amount of influence each retrieval insertion has over the generated sequence.

34765,,2503.12847,Robust Audio-Visual Segmentation via Audio-Guided Visual Convergent Alignment,Accurately localizing audible objects based on audio-visual cues is the core objective of audio-visual segmentation. Most previous methods emphasize spatial or temporal multi-modal modeling## yet overlook challenges from ambiguous audio-visual correspondences--such as nearby visually similar but acoustically different objects and frequent shifts in objects' sounding status. Consequently## they may struggle to reliably correlate audio and visual cues## leading to over- or under-segmentation. To address these limitations## we propose a novel framework with two primary components: an audio-guided modality alignment (AMA) module and an uncertainty estimation (UE) module. Instead of indiscriminately correlating audio-visual cues through a global attention mechanism## AMA performs audio-visual interactions within multiple groups and consolidates group features into compact representations based on their responsiveness to audio cues## effectively directing the model's attention to audio-relevant areas.  Leveraging contrastive learning## AMA further distinguishes sounding regions from silent areas by treating features with strong audio responses as positive samples and weaker responses as negatives. Additionally## UE integrates spatial and temporal information to identify high-uncertainty regions caused by frequent changes in sound state## reducing prediction errors by lowering confidence in these areas.

34503,,2405.16414,Robust Message Embedding via Attention Flow-Based Steganography,Image steganography can hide information in a host image and obtain a stego image that is perceptually indistinguishable from the original one. This technique has tremendous potential in scenarios like copyright protection and information retrospection. Some previous studies have proposed to enhance the robustness of the methods against image disturbances to increase their applicability. However## they generally cannot achieve a satisfying balance between the steganography quality and robustness. Instead of image-in-image steganography## we focus on the issue of message-in-image embedding that is robust to various real-world image distortions. This task aims to embed information into a natural image and the decoding result is required to be completely accurate## which increases the difficulty of data concealing and revealing. Inspired by the recent developments in transformer-based vision models## we discover that the tokenized representation of image is naturally suitable for steganography task.

33215,,,Robust Multi-Object 4D Generation for In-the-wild Videos,We address the challenge of generating dynamic 4D scenes from monocular multi-object videos with heavy occlusions and introduce Robust4DGen## a novel approach that integrates rendering-based deformable 3D Gaussian optimization with generative priors for view synthesis. While existing view-synthesis models excel at novel view generation for isolated objects## they struggle with full scenes due to their complexity and data demands. To overcome this## Robust4DGen decomposes scenes into individual objects## optimizing a differentiable set of deformable Gaussians per object while capturing 2D occlusions from a 3D perspective through joint Gaussian splatting. Joint splatting ensures occlusion-aware rendering losses in observed frames while explicit object decomposition allows the usage of object-centric diffusion models for object completion in unobserved viewpoints. To reconcile the differences between object-centric priors and the global frame-centric coordinate system of the video## Robust4DGen employs differentiable transformations to unify the rendering and generative constraints within a single framework. The result is a model capable of generating 4D objects across space and time while producing 2D and 3D point tracks from monocular videos. To rigorously evaluate the quality of scene generation and the accuracy of the motion under multi-object occlusions## we introduce MOSE-PTS## a subset of the challenging MOSE benchmark## which we annotated with high-quality 2D point tracks.

However## the existing studies always hold the assumption that full modalities are available. As a matter of fact## the cost for collecting genomic data is high## which sometimes makes genomic data unavailable in testing samples. A common way of tackling such incompleteness is to generate the genomic representations from the pathology images. Nevertheless## such strategy still faces the following two challenges: (1) The gigapixel whole slide images (WSIs) are huge and thus hard for representation. (2) It is difficult to generate the genomic embeddings with diverse function categories in a unified generative framework.

Simply concatenating the two input views or encoding their features for a generative model## such as a diffusion model## often fails to produce satisfactory results. The main challenge lies in effectively extracting and fusing meaningful clothing features from these input views. Existing explicit warping based methods## which establish direct correspondence between input and target views## tend to introduce artifacts## particularly when there is a significant disparity between the input and target views.

32619,,,S4-Driver: Scalable Self-Supervised Driving Multimodal Large Language Model with Spatio-Temporal Visual Representation,The latest advancements in multi-modal large language models (MLLMs) have spurred a strong renewed interest in end-to-end motion planning approaches for autonomous driving. Many end-to-end approaches rely on human annotations to learn intermediate perception and prediction tasks## while purely self-supervised approaches--which directly learn from sensor inputs to generate planning trajectories without human annotations--often underperform the state of the art. We observe a key gap in the input representation space: end-to-end approaches built on MLLMs are often pretrained with reasoning tasks in 2D image space rather than the native 3D space in which autonomous vehicles plan. To this end## we propose S4-Driver## a scalable self-supervised motion planning algorithm with spatio-temporal visual representation##  based on the popular PaLI multimodal large language model.

This representation aggregates multi-view and multi-frame visual inputs and enables better prediction of planning trajectories in 3D space. To validate our method## we run experiments on both nuScenes and Waymo Open Motion Dataset (with in-house camera data).

However## extending these capabilities to videos presents substantial challenges## particularly in ensuring precise and temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. SAM 2 attempts to address this by training a model on massive image and video data from scratch to learn complex spatiotemporal associations## resulting in huge training costs that hinder research and practical deployment. In this paper## we introduce SAM-I2V## an effective image-to-video upgradation method for cultivating a promptable video segmentation (PVS) model. Our approach strategically upgrades the pre-trained SAM to support PVS## significantly reducing training complexity and resource requirements. To achieve this## we introduce three key innovations: (i) an image-to-video feature extraction upgrader built upon SAM's static image encoder to enable spatiotemporal video perception## (ii) a memory filtering strategy that selects the most relevant past frames for more effective utilization of historical information## and (iii) a memory-as-prompt mechanism leveraging object memory to ensure temporally consistent mask propagation in dynamic scenes. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves over 90% of SAM 2's performance while using only 0.2% of its training cost.

34301,,,SAM-REF: Introducing Image-Prompt Synergy during Interaction for Detail Enhancement in the Segment Anything Model,Interactive segmentation is to segment the mask of the target object according to the user's interactive prompts. There are two mainstream strategies: early fusion and late fusion. Current specialist models utilize the early fusion strategy that encodes the combination of images and prompts to target the prompted objects## yet repetitive complex computations on the images result in high latency. Late fusion models extract image embeddings once and merge them with the prompts in later interactions. This strategy avoids redundant image feature extraction and improves efficiency significantly. A recent milestone is the Segment Anything Model (SAM). However## this strategy limits the models ability to extract detailed information from the prompted target zone. To address this issue## we propose SAM-REF## a two-stage refinement framework that fully integrates images and prompts by using a lightweight refiner into the interaction of late fusion## which combines the accuracy of early fusion and maintains the efficiency of late fusion. Through extensive experiments## we show that our SAM-REF model outperforms the current state-of-the-art method in most metrics on segmentation quality without compromising efficiency.,0,0

34358,,,SAM2Object: Consolidating View Consistency via SAM2 for Zero-Shot 3D Instance Segmentation,In the field of zero-shot 3D instance segmentation## existing 2D-to-3D lifting methods typically obtain 2D segmentation across multiple RGB frames using vision foundation models## which are then projected and merged into 3D space. However## since the inference of vision foundation models on a single frame is not integrated with adjacent frames## the masks of the same object may vary across different frames## leading to a lack of view consistency in the 2D segmentation. Furthermore## current lifting methods average the 2D segmentation from multiple views during the projection into 3D space## causing low-quality masks and high-quality masks to share the same weight. These factors can lead to fragmented 3D segmentation. In this paper## we present SAM2Object## a novel zero-shot 3D instance segmentation method that effectively utilizes the Segment Anything Model 2 to segment and track objects## consolidating view consistency across frames. Our approach combines these consistent 2D masks with 3D geometric priors## improving the robustness of 3D segmentation. Additionally## we introduce mask consolidation module to filter out low-quality masks across frames## which enables more precise 2D-to-3D matching.

In this work## we aim to surpass these limitations and design an RVOS method capable of effectively operating in streaming-like scenarios while retaining contextual information from past frames. We build upon the Segment-Anything 2 (SAM2) model## that provides robust segmentation and tracking capabilities and is naturally suited for streaming processing. We make SAM2 wiser## by empowering it with natural language understanding and explicit temporal modeling  at the feature extraction stage## without fine-tuning its weights## and without outsourcing modality interaction to external models. To this end## we introduce a novel adapter module that injects temporal information and multi-modal cues in the feature extraction process.

34047,,2409.19850,SATA: Spatial Autocorrelation Token Analysis for Enhancing the Robustness of Vision Transformers,Over the past few years## vision transformers (ViTs) have consistently demonstrated remarkable performance across various visual recognition tasks. However## attempts to enhance their robustness have yielded limited success## mainly focusing on different training strategies## input patch augmentation## or network structural enhancements. These approaches often involve extensive training and fine-tuning## which are time-consuming and resource-intensive. To tackle these obstacles## we introduce a novel approach named Spatial Autocorrelation Token Analysis (SATA). By harnessing spatial relationships between token features## SATA enhances both the representational capacity and robustness of ViT models. This is achieved through the analysis and grouping of tokens according to their spatial autocorrelation scores prior to their input into the Feed-Forward Network (FFN) block of the self-attention mechanism. Importantly## SATA seamlessly integrates into existing pre-trained ViT baselines without requiring retraining or additional fine-tuning## while concurrently improving efficiency by reducing the computational load of the FFN units. Experimental results show that the baseline ViTs enhanced with SATA not only achieve a new state-of-the-art top-1 accuracy on ImageNet-1K image classification (94.9%) but also establish new state-of-the-art performance across multiple robustness benchmarks## including ImageNet-A (top-1=63.6%)## ImageNet-R (top-1=79.2%)## and ImageNet-C (mCE=13.6%)## all without requiring additional training or fine-tuning of baseline models.

34641,,2503.12866,SCAP: Transductive Test-Time Adaptation via Supportive Clique-based Attribute Prompting,Vision-language models (VLMs) encounter considerable challenges when adapting to domain shifts stemming from changes in data distribution. Test-time adaptation (TTA) has emerged as a promising approach to enhance VLM performance under such conditions. In practice## test data often arrives in batches## leading to increasing interest in the transductive TTA setting. However## existing TTA methods primarily focus on individual test samples## overlooking crucial cross-sample correlations within a batch. While recent ViT-based TTA methods have introduced batch-level adaptation## they remain suboptimal for VLMs due to inadequate integration of the text modality. To address these limitations## we propose a novel transductive TTA framework## Supportive Clique-based Attribute Prompting (SCAP)## which effectively combines visual and textual information to enhance adaptation by generating fine-grained attribute prompts across test batches. SCAP first forms supportive cliques of test samples in an unsupervised manner based on visual similarity and learns an attribute prompt for each clique## capturing shared attributes critical for adaptation. For each test sample## SCAP aggregates attribute prompts from its associated cliques## providing enriched contextual information. To ensure adaptability over time## we incorporate a retention module that dynamically updates attribute prompts and their associated attributes as new data arrives.

However## they perform poorly on the content and style images with the same semantics## i.e.## the style of the corresponding semantic region of the generated stylized image is inconsistent with that of the style image. We argue that the root cause lies in their failure to consider the relationship between local regions and semantic regions. To address this issue## we propose a plug-and-play semantic continuous-sparse attention## dubbed SCSA## for arbitrary semantic style transfer---each query point considers certain key points in the corresponding semantic region. Specifically## semantic continuous attention ensures each query point fully attends to all the continuous key points in the same semantic region that reflect the overall style characteristics of that region; Semantic sparse attention allows each query point to focus on the most similar sparse key point in the same semantic region that exhibits the specific stylistic texture of that region. By combining the two modules## the resulting SCSA aligns the overall style of the corresponding semantic regions while transferring the vivid textures of these regions.

The enhanced view transformation constructs accurate depth distributions by integrating pixel semantics and co-point depth through diffusion and bilinear discretization. The fusion-to-occupancy-driven active distillation extracts rich semantic information from multimodal data and selectively transfers knowledge to image features based on LiDAR-identified regions. Finally## for optimal performance## we introduce SDG-Fusion## which uses fusion alone## and SDG-KL## which integrates both fusion and distillation for faster inference.

34652,,,SLVR: Super-Light Visual Reconstruction via Blueprint Controllable Convolutions and Exploring Feature Diversity Representation,Recently## improving the residual structure and designing efficient convolutions have become important branches of lightweight visual reconstruction model design. We have observed that the feature addition mode (FAM) in existing residual structure tends to lead to slow feature learning or stagnation in feature evolution## a phenomenon we define as network inertia. In addition## although blueprint separable convolutions (BSConv) have proved the dominance of intra-kernel correlation## BSConv forces the blueprint to perform scale transformation on all channels## which may lead to incorrect intra-kernel correlation and introduce useless or disruptive features on some channels and hinder the effective propagation of features.

Second## we propose blueprint controllable convolutions (B2Conv). The B2Conv can adaptively pick accurate intra-kernel correlation in the depth-axis## effectively preventing the introduction of useless or disruptive features. Based on FDEL and B2Conv## we develop a super-light super-resolution (SR) framework SLVR for visual reconstruction. Both FDEL and B2Conv can serve as efficient plugins.

33368,,,STEPS: Sequential Probability Tensor Estimation for Text-to-Image Hard Prompt Search,Recent text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in visual synthesis## yet their performance heavily relies on the quality of input prompts. However## optimizing discrete prompts remains challenging because the discrete nature of tokens prevents the direct application of the gradient descent method and the vast search space of possible token combinations. As a result## existing approaches either suffer from quantization errors when employing continuous optimization techniques or become trapped in local optima due to coordinate-wise greedy search. In this paper## we propose STEPS## a novel Sequential probability Tensor Estimation approach for hard Prompt Search. Our method reformulates discrete prompt optimization as a sequential probability tensor estimation problem## leveraging the inherent low-rank characteristics to address the curse of dimensionality. To further improve the computational efficiency## we develop a memory-bounded sampling approach that shrinks the prompt space without the iteration step dependency while preserving sequential optimization dynamics.

32792,,2408.16807,STEREO: A Two-Stage Framework for Adversarially Robust Concept Erasing from Text-to-Image Diffusion Models,The rapid proliferation of large-scale text-to-image diffusion (T2ID) models has raised serious concerns about their potential misuse in generating harmful content.  Although numerous methods have been proposed for erasing undesired concepts from T2ID models## they often provide a false sense of security; concept-erased models (CEMs) can still be manipulated via adversarial attacks to regenerate the erased concept. While a few robust concept erasure methods based on adversarial training have emerged recently## they compromise on utility (generation quality for benign concepts) to achieve robustness and/or remain vulnerable to advanced embedding space attacks. These limitations stem from the failure of robust CEMs to thoroughly search for blind spots in the embedding space. To bridge this gap## we propose STEREO## a novel two-stage framework that employs adversarial training as a first step rather than the only step for robust concept erasure. In the first stage## STEREO employs adversarial training as a vulnerability identification mechanism to search thoroughly enough. In the second robustly erase once stage## STEREO introduces an anchor-concept-based compositional objective to robustly erase the target concept in a single fine-tuning stage## while minimizing the degradation of model utility. We benchmark STEREO against seven state-of-the-art concept erasure methods## demonstrating its superior robustness to both white-box and black-box attacks## while largely preserving utility.,0,0

33123,,2503.15973,STOP: Integrated Spatial-Temporal Dynamic Prompting for Video Understanding,Pre-trained on tremendous image-text pairs## vision-language models like CLIP have demonstrated promising zero-shot generalization across numerous image-based tasks. However## extending these capabilities to video tasks remains challenging due to limited labeled video data and high training costs. Recent video prompting methods attempt to adapt CLIP for video tasks by introducing learnable prompts## but they typically rely on a single static prompt for all video sequences## overlooking the diverse temporal dynamics and spatial variations that exist across frames. This limitation significantly hinders the model's ability to capture essential temporal information for effective video understanding. To address this## we propose an integrated Spatial-TempOral dynamic Prompting (STOP) model which consists of two complementary modules## the intra-frame spatial prompting and inter-frame temporal prompting. Our intra-frame spatial prompts are designed to adaptively highlight discriminative regions within each frame by leveraging intra-frame attention and temporal variation## allowing the model to focus on areas with substantial temporal dynamics and capture fine-grained spatial details. Additionally## to highlight the varying importance of frames for video understanding## we further introduce inter-frame temporal prompts## dynamically inserting prompts between frames with high temporal variance as measured by frame similarity. This enables the model to prioritize key frames and enhances its capacity to understand temporal dependencies across sequences.

In this paper## we propose a novel video depth completion method## called SVDC## by fusing the sparse dToF data with the corresponding RGB guidance. Our method employs a multi-frame fusion scheme to mitigate the spatial ambiguity resulting from the sparse dToF imaging. Misalignment between consecutive frames during multi-frame fusion could cause blending between object edges and the background## which results in a loss of detail. To address this## we introduce an adaptive frequency selective fusion (AFSF) module## which automatically selects convolution kernel sizes to fuse multi-frame features. Our AFSF utilizes a channel-spatial enhancement attention (CSEA) module to enhance features and generates an attention map as fusion weights. The AFSF ensures edge detail recovery while suppressing high-frequency noise in smooth regions.

In pursuit of an answer## we employ vision-based knowledge distillation to train a series of T5 encoder models. To fully inherit its capabilities## we constructed our dataset based on three criteria: image quality## semantic understanding## and text-rendering. Our results demonstrate the scaling down pattern that the distilled T5-base model can generate images of comparable quality to those produced by T5-XXL## while being 50 times smaller in size. This reduction in model size significantly lowers the GPU requirements for running state-of-the-art models such as FLUX and SD3## making high-quality text-to-image generation more accessible.,0,0
32892,,,Scaling Inference Time Compute for Diffusion Models,Generative models have made significant impacts across various domains## largely due to their ability to scale during training by increasing data## computational resources## and model size## a phenomenon characterized by the scaling laws. Recent research has begun to explore inference-time scaling behavior in Large Language Models (LLMs)## revealing how performance can further improve with additional computation during inference. Unlike LLMs## diffusion models inherently possess the flexibility to adjust inference-time computation via the number of denoising steps## although the performance gains typically flatten after a few dozen. In this work## we explore the inference-time scaling behavior of diffusion models beyond increasing denoising steps and investigate how the generation performance can further improve with increased computation. Specifically## we consider a search problem aimed at identifying better noises for the diffusion sampling process. We structure the design space along two axes: the verifiers used to provide feedback## and the algorithms used to find better noise candidates. Through extensive experiments on class-conditioned and text-conditioned image generation benchmarks## our findings reveal that increasing inference-time compute leads to substantial improvements in the quality of samples generated by diffusion models## and with the complicated nature of images## combinations of the components in the framework can be specifically chosen to conform with different application scenario.,0,0

33120,,2503.19903,Scaling Vision Pre-Training to 4K Resolution,High-resolution perception of visual details is crucial for daily tasks. Current vision pre-training## however## is still limited to low resolutions (e.g.## 378 x 378 pixels) due to the quadratic cost of processing larger images. We introduce PS3 that scales CLIP-style vision pre-training to 4K resolution with a near-constant cost. Instead of contrastive learning on global image representation## PS3 is pre-trained by selectively processing local regions and contrasting them with local detailed captions## enabling high-resolution representation learning with greatly reduced computational overhead. The pre-trained PS3 is able to both encode the global image at low resolution and selectively process local high-resolution regions based on their saliency or relevance to a text prompt. When applying PS3 to multi-modal LLM (MLLM)## the resulting model## named VILA-HD## significantly improves high-resolution visual perception compared to baselines without high-resolution vision pre-training such as AnyRes and S^2 while using up to 4.3x fewer tokens. PS3 also unlocks appealing scaling properties of VILA-HD## including scaling up resolution for free and scaling up test-time compute for better performance. Compared to state of the arts## VILA-HD outperforms previous MLLMs such as NVILA and Qwen2-VL across multiple benchmarks and achieves better efficiency than latest token pruning approaches. Finally## we find current benchmarks do not require 4K-resolution perception## which motivates us to propose 4KPro## a new benchmark of image QA at 4K resolution## on which VILA-HD outperforms all previous MLLMs## including a 14.5% improvement over GPT-4o## and a 3.2% improvement and 2.96x speedup over Qwen2-VL.,0,0
33937,,,Scaling up Image Segmentation across Data and Tasks,Traditional segmentation models## while effective in isolated tasks## often fail to generalize to more complex and open-ended segmentation problems## such as free-form## open-vocabulary## and in-the-wild scenarios. To bridge this gap## we propose to scale up image segmentation across diverse datasets and tasks such that the knowledge across different tasks and datasets can be integrated while improving the generalization ability. QueryMeldNet## a novel segmentation framework## is introduced and designed to scale seamlessly across both data size and task diversity. It is built upon a dynamic object query mechanism called query meld## which fuses different types of queries using cross-attention. This hybrid approach enables the model to balance between instance- and stuff-level segmentation## providing enhanced scalability for handling diverse object types. We further enhance scalability by leveraging synthetic data-generating segmentation masks and captions for pixel-level and open-vocabulary tasks-drastically reducing the need for costly human annotations. By training on multiple datasets and tasks at scale## QueryMeldNet continuously improves performance as the volume and diversity of data and tasks increase.

33702,,2503.22496,Scenario Dreamer: Vectorized Latent Diffusion for Generating Driving Simulation Environments,We introduce Scenario Dreamer## a fully data-driven generative simulator for autonomous vehicle planning that generates both the initial traffic scene--comprising a lane graph and agent bounding boxes--and closed-loop agent behaviours. Existing methods for generating driving simulation environments encode the initial traffic scene as a rasterized image and## as such## require parameter-heavy networks that perform unnecessary computation due to many empty pixels in the rasterized scene. Moreover## we find that existing methods that employ rule-based agent behaviours lack diversity and realism. Scenario Dreamer instead employs a novel vectorized latent diffusion model for initial scene generation that directly operates on the vectorized scene elements and an autoregressive Transformer for data-driven agent behaviour simulation. Scenario Dreamer additionally supports scene extrapolation via diffusion inpainting## enabling the generation of unbounded simulation environments. Extensive experiments show that Scenario Dreamer outperforms existing generative simulators in realism and efficiency: the vectorized scene-generation base model achieves superior generation quality with around 2x fewer parameters## 6x lower generation latency## and 10x fewer GPU training hours compared to the strongest baseline. We confirm its practical utility by showing that reinforcement learning planning agents are more challenged in Scenario Dreamer environments than traditional non-generative simulation environments## especially on long and adversarial driving environments.,0,0
32828,,,Scene Map-based Prompt Tuning for Navigation Instruction Generation,Navigation instruction generation (NIG)## which provides interactive feedback and guidance to humans along a trajectory## is vital for developing embodied agents capable of human-machine communication and collaboration through natural language. Early data-driven methods directly map sequences of past observations to trajectory descriptions on limited datasets## lacking the necessary spatial understanding in complex 3D environments. While recent approaches leverage Large Language Models (LLMs) to improve NIG## they often overlook the global spatial context in navigation## such as the inherent space discretization in maps. Instead of straightforwardly feeding textual descriptions of the map into LLMs## we propose a scene map-based prompt tuning framework for NIG## MAPInstructor## which incorporates map context for parameter-efficient updating of LLMs. MAPInstructor comprises three key components: (i) scene representation encoding## where egocentric observations are projected into 3D voxels for fine-grained scene understanding; (ii) map prompt tuning## which integrates a topological map representation of the entire trajectory into an LLM-based decoder; and (iii) landmark uncertainty assessment## which mitigates hallucinations in landmark predictions## thereby enhancing the reliability and coherence of instruction generation.

34360,,2504.02764,Scene Splatter: Momentum 3D Scene Generation from Single Image with Video Diffusion Model,In this paper## we propose Scene Splatter## a momentum-based paradigm for video diffusion to generate generic scenes from single image. Existing methods## which employ video generation models to synthesize novel views## suffer from limited video length and scene inconsistency## leading to artifacts and distortions during further reconstruction. To address this issue## we construct noisy samples from original features as momentum to enhance video details and maintain scene consistency. However## for latent features with the perception field that spans both known and unknown regions## such latent-level momentum restricts the generative ability of video diffusion in unknown regions. Therefore## we further introduce the aforementioned consistent video as a pixel-level momentum to a directly generated video without momentum for better recovery of unseen regions. Our cascaded momentum enables video diffusion models to generate both high-fidelity and consistent novel views. We further finetune the global Gaussian representations with enhanced frames and render new frames for momentum update in the next step. In this manner## we can iteratively recover a 3D scene## avoiding the limitation of video length.

33740,,2504.00387,Scene4U: Hierarchical Layered 3D Scene Reconstruction from Single Panoramic Image for Your Immerse Exploration,The reconstruction of immersive and realistic 3D scenes holds significant practical importance in various fields of computer vision and computer graphics. Typically## immersive and realistic scenes should be free from obstructions by dynamic objects## maintain global texture consistency## and allow for unrestricted exploration. The current mainstream methods for image-driven scene construction involves iteratively refining the initial image using a moving virtual camera to generate the scene. However## previous methods struggle with visual discontinuities due to global texture inconsistencies under varying camera poses## and they frequently exhibit scene voids caused by foreground-background occlusions. To this end## we propose a novel layered 3D scene reconstruction framework from panoramic image## named Scene4U. Specifically## Scene4U integrates an open-vocabulary segmentation model with a large language model to decompose a real panorama into multiple layers. Then## we employs a layered repair module based on diffusion model to restore occluded regions using visual cues and depth information## generating a hierarchical representation of the scene. The multi-layer panorama is then initialized as a 3D Gaussian Splatting representation## followed by layered optimization## which ultimately produces an immersive 3D scene with semantic and structural consistency that supports free exploration. Our Scene4U outperforms state-of-the-art method## improving by 24.24% in LPIPS and 24.40% in BRISQUE## while also achieving the fastest training speed.

However## these models typically rely on the predetermined denoising schedules for all prompts. The multi-step reverse diffusion process can be regarded as a kind of chain-of-thought for generating high-quality images step by step. Therefore## diffusion models should reason for each instance to determine the optimal noise schedule adaptively## achieving high generation quality with sampling efficiency. In this paper## we introduce the Time Prediction Diffusion Model (TPDM) for this. TPDM employs a plug-and-play Time Prediction Module (TPM) that predicts the next noise level based on current latent features at each denoising step.  We train the TPM using reinforcement learning to maximize a reward that encourages high final image quality while penalizing excessive denoising steps.

33654,,,Sea-ing in Low-light,Underwater (UW) robotics applications require depth and restored images simultaneously in real-time## irrespective of whether the UW images are captured in good lighting conditions or not. Most of the UW image restoration and depth estimation methods have been devised for images under normal lighting. Consequently## they struggle to perform on poorly lit images. Even though artificial illumination can be used when there is insufficient ambient light## it can introduce non-uniform lighting artifacts in the restored images. Hence## the recovery of depth and restored images directly from Low-Light UW (LLUW) images is a critical requirement in marine applications. While a few works have attempted LLUW image restoration## there are no reported works on joint recovery of depth and clean image from LLUW images. We propose a Self-supervised Low-light Underwater Image and Depth recovery network (SelfLUID-Net) for joint estimation of depth and restored image in real-time from a single LLUW image. We have collected an Underwater Low-light Stereo Video (ULVStereo) dataset which is the first-ever UW dataset with stereo pairs of low-light and normally-lit UW images. For the dual tasks of image and depth recovery from a LLUW image## we effectively utilize the stereo data from ULVStereo that provides cues for both depth and illumination-independent clean image. We harness a combination of the UW image formation process## the Retinex model## and constraints enforced by the scene geometry for our self-supervised training. To handle occlusions## we additionally utilize monocular frames from our video dataset and propose a masking scheme to prevent dynamic transients## that do not respect the underlying scene geometry## from misguiding the learning process.

35123,,2505.16652,Seeing Far and Clearly: Mitigating Hallucinations in MLLMs with Attention Causal Decoding,Recent advancements in multimodal large language models (MLLMs) have significantly improved performance in visual question answering. However## they often suffer from hallucinations. In this work## hallucinations are categorized into two main types: initial hallucinations and snowball hallucinations. We argue that adequate contextual information can be extracted directly from the token interaction process. Inspired by causal inference in decoding strategy## we propose to leverage causal masks to establish information propagation between multimodal tokens. The hypothesis is that insufficient interaction between those tokens may lead the model to rely on outlier tokens## overlooking dense and rich contextual cues.

Existing 3D attackers mainly put effort into attacking the simple 3D classification model by perturbing point cloud objects in the white/black-box setting. However## real-world 3D applications focus on tackling more complicated scene-based data while sharing no information about the model parameters and logits with users. Therefore## directly applying previous naive 3D attack methods to these applications does not work.

To make the attack effective and stealthy## we propose to generate universal adversarial objects## which will mislead scene-aware 3D models to predict attacker-chosen labels whenever these objects are placed on any scene input. Specifically## we inject an imperceptible object trigger with further perturbations into all scenes and learn to mislead their reasoning by only querying the 3D model. We start by initializing the trigger pattern with a realistic object and searching for an appropriate location to place it naturally in the scene data. Then## we design a novel weighted gradient estimation strategy to perturb the object trigger with additive slight noise to make them adversarial in an iterative optimization procedure.

However## large shifts between training and test domains degrade their performance## requiring fine-tuning for effective real-world applications. We introduce Semantic Library Adaptation (SemLA)## a novel framework for training-free## test-time domain adaptation.

35077,,2310.14356,Semantic and Expressive Variations in Image Captions Across Languages,Most vision-language models today are primarily trained on English image-text pairs## with non-English pairs often filtered out. Evidence from cross-cultural psychology suggests that this approach will bias models against perceptual modes exhibited by people who speak other (non-English) languages. We investigate semantic and expressive variation in image captions across different languages; we analyze both human-annotated datasets and model-produced captions. By analyzing captions across seven languages (English## French## German## Russian## Chinese## Japanese## Korean) in high-quality image captioning datasets (Crossmodal and Visual Genome)## we find that multilingual caption sets tend to provide richer visual descriptions than monolingual (including English-only) ones; multilingual sets contain 46.0% more objects## 66.1% more relationships## and 66.8% more attributes. We observe the same results with multilingual captions produced by LLaVA and the Google Vertex API: for example## compared to monolingual captions## they cover 21.9% more objects##18.8% more relations## and 20.1% more attributes. These suggest that## across a large number of samples## different languages bias people and models to focus on different visual concepts. Finally## we show that models trained on image-text data in one language perform distinctly better on that language's test set. Our work points towards the potential value of training vision models on multilingual data sources to widen the range/variation of descriptive information those models are exposed to.,0,0
33595,,,Semantic and Sequential Alignment for Referring Video Object Segmentation,Referring video object segmentation (RVOS) seeks to segment the objects within a video referred by linguistic expressions. Existing RVOS solutions follow a 'fuse then select' paradigm: establishing semantic correlation between visual and linguistic feature## and performing frame-level query interaction to select the instance mask per frame with instance segmentation module. This paradigm overlooks the challenge of semantic gap between the linguistic descriptor and the video object as well as the underlying clutters in the video. This paper proposes a novel Semantic and Sequential Alignment (SSA) paradigm to handle these challenges. We first insert a lightweight adapter after the vision language model (VLM) to perform the semantic alignment. Then## prior to selecting mask per frame## we exploit the trajectory-to-instance enhancement for each frame via sequential alignment. This paradigm leverages the visual-language alignment inherent in VLM during adaptation and tries to capture global information by ensembling trajectories. This helps understand videos and the corresponding descriptors by mitigating the discrepancy with intricate activity semantics## particularly when facing occlusion or similar interference. SSA demonstrates competitive performance while maintaining fewer learnable parameters.,0,0

Existing ZSSAR approaches often rely on manually crafted action descriptions or visual assumptions to enhance knowledge transfer## which is limited in flexibility and prone to inaccuracies and noise. To overcome this## we introduce Semantic-guided Cross-Modal Prompt Learning (SCoPLe)## a novel framework that replaces manual guidance with data-driven  prompt learning for refinement and alignment of skeletal and textual features. Specifically## we introduce a dual-stream language prompting module that preserves the original semantic context from the pre-trained text encoder while still effectively tuning its ouput for ZSSAR task adaptation. We also introduce a joint-shaped prompting module that learns tuning for skeleton features and incorporate an adaptive visual representation sampler that leverages text semantics to strengthen the cross-modal prompting interactions during skeleton-to-text embedding projection.

Although intuitive## a simple amalgamation of DA and SSL is suboptimal in semantic segmentation due to two major reasons: (1) previous methods## while able to learn good segmentation boundaries## are prone to confuse classes with similar visual appearance due to limited supervision; and (2) skewed and imbalanced training data distribution preferring source representation learning whereas impeding from exploring limited information about tailed classes. Language guidance can serve as a pivotal semantic bridge## facilitating robust class discrimination and mitigating visual ambiguities by leveraging the rich semantic relationships encoded in pre-trained language models to enhance feature representations across domains.

However## directly applying existing semi-supervised methods of general scenes to SSTS will face new challenges: 1) inconsistent pseudo labels between detection and recognition tasks## and 2) sub-optimal supervisions caused by inconsistency between teacher/student. Thus## we propose a new Semi-supervised framework for End-to-end Text Spotting## namely SemiETS that leverages the complementarity of text detection and recognition. Specifically## it gradually generates reliable hierarchical pseudo labels for each task## thereby reducing noisy labels. Meanwhile## it extracts important information in locations and transcriptions from bidirectional flows to improve consistency. Extensive experiments on three datasets under various settings demonstrate the effectiveness of SemiETS on arbitrary-shaped text.

Recently## sensitivity-aware parameter efficient fine-tuning method (SPT) addresses this problem by identifying sensitive parameters and then leveraging its sparse characteristic to combine unstructured and structured tuning for PEFT. However## existing methods only focus on sparse characteristic of sensitive parameters but overlook its distribution characteristic## which results in additional storage burden and limited performance improvement. In this paper## we find that the distribution of sensitive parameters is not chaotic## but concentrates in a small number of rows or columns in each parameter matrix. Inspired by this fact## we propose a Compact Dynamic-Rank Adaptation-based tuning method for Sensitivity-aware Parameter efficient fine-Tuning## called CDRA-SPT. Specifically## we first identify the sensitive parameters that require tuning for each downstream task.

34947,,,Sharp-It: A Multi-view to Multi-view Diffusion Model for 3D Synthesis and Manipulation,Advancements in text-to-image diffusion models have led to significant progress in fast 3D content creation. One common approach is to generate a set of multi-view images of an object## and then reconstruct it into a 3D model. However## this approach bypasses the use of a native 3D representation of the object and is hence prone to geometric artifacts and limited in controllability and manipulation capabilities. An alternative approach involves native 3D generative models that directly produce 3D representations.

To address this limitation we propose a framework that includes a dataset collection pipeline and architectural extensions to video diffusion models to enable text-to-multi-shot video generation. Our approach enables generation of multi-shot videos as a single video with full attention across all frames of all shots## ensuring character and background consistency## and allows users to control the number## duration## and content of shots through shot-specific conditioning.

To obtain training data we propose a novel data collection pipeline to construct a multi-shot video dataset from existing single-shot video datasets. Extensive experiments demonstrate that fine-tuning a pre-trained text-to-video model for a few thousand iterations is enough for the model to subsequently be able to generate multi-shot videos with shot-specific control## outperforming the baselines.

While deep learning has made significant advances## current approaches struggle to generalize as they require task-specific training or fine-tuning on unseen classes. We present Iris## a novel In-context Reference Image guided Segmentation framework that enables flexible adaptation to novel tasks through the use of reference examples without fine-tuning. At its core## Iris features a lightweight context task encoding module that distills task-specific information from reference context image-label pairs.

However## unlike humans they lack the ability to explain their decisions by showing where and telling what concepts guided them. In this work## we present a unified framework for transforming any vision neural network into a spatially and conceptually interpretable model.

34134,,,Silence is Golden: Leveraging Adversarial Examples to Nullify Audio Control in LDM-based Talking-Head Generation,Advances in talking-head animation based on Latent Diffusion Models (LDM) enable the creation of highly realistic## synchronized videos. These fabricated videos are indistinguishable from real ones## increasing the risk of potential misuse for scams## political manipulation## and misinformation. Hence## addressing these ethical concerns has become a pressing issue in AI security. Recent proactive defense studies focused on countering LDM-based models by adding perturbations to portraits. However## these methods are ineffective at protecting reference portraits from advanced image-to-video animation.

To address these challenges## we propose Silencer## a two-stage method designed to proactively protect the privacy of portraits. First## a nullifying loss is proposed to ignore audio control in talking-head generation.

32651,,2312.04540,Sim-to-Real Causal Transfer: A Metric Learning Approach to Causally-Aware Interaction Representations,Modeling spatial-temporal interactions among neighboring agents is at the heart of multi-agent problems such as motion forecasting and crowd navigation. Despite notable progress## it remains unclear to which extent modern representations can capture the causal relationships behind agent interactions. In this work## we take an in-depth look at the causal awareness of these representations## from computational formalism to real-world practice. First## we revisit the notion of non-causal robustness studied in the recent CausalAgents benchmark. We show that existing representations are already partially resilient to perturbations of non-causal agents## and yet modeling indirect causal effects involving mediator agents remains challenging. To address this challenge## we introduce a metric learning approach that regularizes latent representations with causal annotations. Our controlled experiments show that this approach not only leads to higher degrees of causal awareness but also yields stronger out-of-distribution robustness. To further operationalize it in practice## we propose a sim-to-real causal transfer method via cross-domain multi-task learning. Experiments on trajectory prediction datasets show that our method can significantly boost generalization## even in the absence of real-world causal annotations## where we acquire higher prediction accuracy by only using 25% of real-world data.

The primary challenge lies in representing the hair and garment geometry in a way that allows leveraging established prior knowledge from foundational image diffusion models (e.g.## Stable Diffusion) while being simulation-ready using either physics or neural simulators. To address this task## we propose a two-stage framework that combines the flexibility of 3D Gaussians with simulation-ready hair strands and garment meshes. Specifically## we first leverage two text-conditioned diffusion models to generate garment mesh and hair strands from the given text prompt. To leverage prior knowledge from foundational diffusion models## we attach 3D Gaussians to the body mesh## garment mesh## as well as hair strands and learn the avatar appearance through optimization. To drive the avatar given a pose sequence## we first apply physics simulators onto the garment meshes and hair strands. We then transfer the motion onto 3D Gaussians through carefully designed mechanism for different body parts. As a result## our synthesized avatars have vivid texture and realistic dynamic motion.

While substantial progress has been made in this task for natural images## the advancements for remote sensing (RS) images still remain limited## primarily due to these two challenges. 1) Existing RS semantic categories are limited## particularly for pixel-level interpretation datasets. 2) Distinguishing among diverse RS spatial regions solely by language space is challenging due to the dense and intricate spatial distribution in open-world RS imagery. To address the first issue## we develop a fine-grained RS interpretation dataset## Sky-SA## which contains 183##375 high-quality local image-text pairs with full-pixel manual annotations## covering 1##763 category labels## exhibiting richer semantics and higher density than previous datasets. Afterwards## to solve the second issue## we introduce the vision-centric principle for vision-language modeling. Specifically## in the pre-training stage## the visual self-supervised paradigm is incorporated into image-text alignment## reducing the degradation of general visual representation capabilities of existing paradigms. Then## we construct a visual-relevance knowledge graph across open-category texts and further develop a novel vision-centric image-text contrastive loss for fine-tuning with text prompts. This new model## denoted as SkySense-O## demonstrates impressive zero-shot capabilities on a thorough evaluation encompassing 14 datasets over 4 tasks## from recognizing to reasoning and classification to localization.

33491,,2412.04852,SleeperMark: Towards Robust Watermark against Fine-Tuning Text-to-image Diffusion Models,Recent advances in large-scale text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models have enabled a variety of downstream applications. As T2I models require extensive resources for training## they constitute highly valued intellectual property (IP) for their legitimate owners## yet making them incentive targets for unauthorized fine-tuning by adversaries seeking to leverage these models for customized## usually profitable applications. Existing IP protection methods for diffusion models generally involve embedding watermark patterns and then verifying ownership through generated outputs examination## or inspecting the model's feature space. However## these techniques are inherently ineffective in practical scenarios when the watermarked model undergoes fine-tuning## and the feature space is inaccessible during verification (i.e.## black-box setting). The model is prone to forgetting the previously learned watermark knowledge when it adapts to a new task. To address this challenge## we propose SleeperMark## a novel framework designed to embed resilient watermarks into T2I diffusion models. SleeperMark explicitly guides the model to disentangle the watermark information from the semantic concepts it learns## allowing the model to retain the embedded watermark while continuing to be adapted to new downstream tasks. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of SleeperMark across various types of diffusion models## including latent diffusion models (e.g.## Stable Diffusion) and pixel diffusion models (e.g.## DeepFloyd-IF)## showing robustness against downstream fine-tuning and various attacks at both the image and model levels## with minimal impact on the model's generative capability.,0,0

34525,,,SmartCLIP: Modular Vision-language Alignment with Identification Guarantees,Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training (CLIP) \citep radford2021learning  has emerged as a pivotal model in computer vision and multimodal learning## achieving state-of-the-art performance at aligning visual and textual representations through contrastive learning. However## CLIP struggles with potential information misalignment in many image-text datasets and suffers from entangled representation. On the one hand## short captions for a single image in datasets like MSCOCO may describe disjoint regions in the image## leaving the model uncertain about which visual features to retain or disregard. On the other hand## directly aligning long captions with images can lead to the retention of entangled details## preventing the model from learning disentangled## atomic concepts -- ultimately limiting its generalization on certain downstream tasks involving short prompts. In this paper## we establish theoretical conditions that enable flexible alignment between textual and visual representations across varying levels of granularity. Specifically## our framework ensures that a model can not only preserve cross-modal semantic information in its entirety but also disentangle visual representations to capture fine-grained textual concepts.  Building on this foundation## we introduce \ours## a novel approach that identifies and aligns the most relevant visual and textual representations in a modular manner. Superior performance across various tasks demonstrates its capability to handle information misalignment and supports our identification theory.

33716,,2501.08279,SmartEraser: Remove Anything from Images using Masked-Region Guidance,Object removal has so far been dominated by the mask-and-inpaint paradigm## where the masked region is excluded from the input## leaving models relying on unmasked areas to inpaint the missing region. However## this approach lacks contextual information for the masked area## often resulting in unstable performance. In this work## we introduce SmartEraser## built with a new removing paradigm called Masked-Region Guidance.

It offers several distinct advantages: (a) it guides the model to accurately identify the object to be removed## preventing its regeneration in the output; (b) since the user mask often extends beyond the object itself## it aids in preserving the surrounding context in the final result. Leveraging this new paradigm## we present Syn4Removal## a large-scale object removal dataset## where instance segmentation data is used to copy and paste objects onto images as removal targets## with the original images serving as ground truths. Experimental results demonstrate that SmartEraser significantly outperforms existing methods## achieving superior performance in object removal## especially in complex scenes with intricate compositions.,0,0

This paper aims to address all of these challenges by developing an extremely small and fast T2I model that generates high-resolution and high-quality images on mobile platforms. We propose several techniques to achieve this goal. First## we systematically examine the design choices of the network architecture to reduce model parameters and latency## while ensuring high-quality generation. Second## to further improve generation quality## we employ cross-architecture knowledge distillation from a much larger model## using a multi-level approach to guide the training of our model from scratch. Third## we enable a few-step generation by integrating adversarial guidance with knowledge distillation.

34157,,2412.04077,SoMA: Singular Value Decomposed Minor Components Adaptation for Domain Generalizable Representation Learning,Domain generalization (DG) aims to adapt a model using one or multiple source domains to ensure robust performance in unseen target domains. Recently## Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) of foundation models has shown promising results in the context of DG problem. Nevertheless## existing PEFT methods still struggle to strike a balance between preserving generalizable components of the pre-trained model and learning task-specific features. To gain insights into the distribution of generalizable components## we begin by analyzing the pre-trained weights  through the lens of singular value decomposition. Building on these insights## we introduce Singular Value Decomposed Minor Components Adaptation (SoMA)## an approach that selectively tunes minor singular components while keeping the residual parts frozen. SoMA effectively retains the generalization ability of the pre-trained model while efficiently acquiring task-specific skills. Moreover## we freeze domain-generalizable blocks and employ an annealing weight decay strategy## thereby achieving an optimal balance in the delicate trade-off between generalizability and discriminability. SoMA attains state-of-the-art results on multiple benchmarks that span both domain generalized semantic segmentation to domain generalized object detection.

33263,,2503.00359,Solving Instance Detection from an Open-World Perspective,Instance detection (InsDet) aims to localize specific object instances within a novel scene imagery based on given visual references. Technically## it requires proposal detection to identify all possible object instances## followed by instance-level matching to pinpoint the ones of interest. Its open-world nature supports its broad applications from robotics to AR/VR but also presents significant challenges: methods must generalize to unknown testing data distributions because (1) the testing scene imagery is unseen during training## and (2) there are domain gaps between visual references and detected proposals. Existing methods tackle these challenges by synthesizing diverse training examples or utilizing off-the-shelf foundation models (FMs). However## they only partially capitalize the available open-world information. In contrast## we approach InsDet from an Open-World perspective## introducing our method IDOW. We find that## while pretrained FMs yield high recall in instance detection## they are not specifically optimized for instance-level feature matching. Therefore## we adapt pretrained FMs for improved instance-level matching using open-world data. Our approach incorporates metric learning along with novel data augmentations## which sample distractors as negative examples and synthesize novel-view instances to enrich the visual references.

We find that existing 3D self-supervised learning approaches fall short when evaluated on representation quality through linear probing. We hypothesize that this is due to what we term the 'geometric shortcut'## which causes representations to collapse to low-level spatial features. This challenge is unique to 3D and arises from the sparse nature of point cloud data. We address it through two key strategies: obscuring spatial information and enhancing the reliance on input features## ultimately composing a Sonata of 140k point clouds through self-distillation. Sonata is simple and intuitive## yet its learned representations are strong and reliable: zero-shot visualizations demonstrate semantic grouping## alongside strong spatial reasoning through nearest-neighbor relationships. Sonata demonstrates exceptional parameter and data efficiency## tripling linear probing accuracy (from 21.8% to 72.5%) on ScanNet and nearly doubling performance with only 1% of the data compared to previous approaches.

33796,,2411.16331,Sonic: Shifting Focus to Global Audio Perception in Portrait Animation,The study of talking face generation mainly explores the intricacies of synchronizing facial movements and crafting  visually appealing## temporally-coherent animations. However## due to the limited exploration of global audio perception## current approaches predominantly employ auxiliary visual and spatial knowledge to stabilize the movements## which often results in the deterioration of the naturalness and temporal inconsistencies.Considering the essence of audio-driven animation## the audio signal serves as the ideal and unique priors to adjust facial expressions and lip movements## without resorting to interference of any visual signals. Based on this motivation## we propose a novel paradigm## dubbed as Sonic## to shift focus on the exploration of global audio perception. To effectively leverage global audio knowledge## we disentangle it into intra- and inter-clip audio perception and collaborate with both aspects to enhance overall perception. For the intra-clip audio perception## 1). Context-enhanced audio learning## in which long-range intra-clip temporal audio knowledge is extracted to provide facial expression and lip  motion priors implicitly expressed as the tone and speed of speech. 2). Motion-decoupled Controller## in which the motion of the head and expression movement are disentangled and independently controlled by intra-audio clips. Most importantly## for inter-clip audio perception## as a bridge to connect the intra-clips to achieve the global perception## Time-aware position shift fusion## in which the global inter-clip audio information is considered and fused for long-audio inference via through consecutively time-aware shifted windows.

34806,,,Sound Bridge: Associating Egocentric and Exocentric Videos via Audio Cues,Understanding human behavior and the environmental information in the egocentric video is very challenging due to the invisibility of some actions (e.g.## laughing and sneezing) and the local nature of the first-person view. Leveraging the corresponding exocentric video to provide global context has shown promising results. However## existing visual-to-visual and visual-to-textual Ego-Exo video alignment methods struggle with the problem that there could be non-visual overlap for the same activity. To address this## we propose using sound as a bridge## as audio is often consistent across Ego-Exo videos. However## direct audio-to-audio alignment lacks context. Thus## we introduce two context-aware sound modules: one aligns audio with vision via a visual-audio cross-attention module## and another aligns text with sound closed caption generated by LLM. Experimental results on two Ego-Exo video association benchmarks show that either of the two proposed modules manages to improve the state-of-the-art methods.

32852,,,Stochastic Human Motion Prediction with Memory of Action Transition and Action Characteristic,Action-driven stochastic human motion prediction aims to generate future motion sequences of a pre-defined target action based on given past observed sequences performing non-target actions. This task primarily presents two challenges. Firstly## generating smooth transition motions is hard due to the varying transition speeds of different actions. Secondly## the action characteristic is difficult to be learned because of the similarity of some actions. These issues cause the predicted results to be unreasonable and inconsistent. As a result## we propose two memory banks## the Soft-transition Action Bank (STAB) and Action Characteristic Bank (ACB)## to tackle the problems above. The STAB stores the action transition information. It is equipped with the novel soft searching approach## which encourages the model to focus on multiple possible action categories of observed motions. The ACB records action characteristic## which produces more prior information for predicting certain actions. To fuse the features retrieved from the two banks better## we further propose the Adaptive Attention Adjustment (AAA) strategy. Extensive experiments on four motion prediction datasets demonstrate that our approach consistently outperforms the previous state-of-the-art.

The subnets are typically trained with a static training strategy (e.g.## using the same learning rate (LR) scheduler and optimizer for all subnets). This## however## does not consider that individual subnets have distinct characteristics## leading to two problems: (1) The supernet training is biased towards the low-complexity subnets (unfairness); (2) the momentum update in the supernet is noisy (noisy momentum). We present a dynamic supernet training technique to address these problems by adjusting the training strategy adaptive to the subnets. Specifically## we introduce a complexity-aware LR scheduler (CaLR) that controls the decay ratio of LR adaptive to the complexities of subnets## which alleviates the unfairness problem. We also present a momentum separation technique (MS). It groups the subnets with similar structural characteristics and uses a separate momentum for each group## avoiding the noisy momentum problem. Our approach can be applicable to various N-shot NAS methods with marginal cost## while improving the search performance drastically.

While adversarial training is widely acknowledged as a promising defense strategy## most existing studies primarily focus on balanced datasets## neglecting the fact that real-world data often exhibit a long-tailed distribution## which introduces substantial challenges to robustness. In this paper## we provide an in-depth analysis of adversarial training in the context of long-tailed distributions and identify the limitations of the current state-of-the-art method## AT-BSL## in achieving robust performance under such conditions. To address these challenges## we propose a novel training framework## TAET## which incorporates an initial stabilization phase followed by a stratified## equalization adversarial training phase. Furthermore## prior work on long-tailed robustness has largely overlooked a crucial evaluation metric--Balanced Accuracy. To fill this gap## we introduce the concept of Balanced Robustness## a comprehensive metric that measures robustness specifically under long-tailed distributions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms existing advanced defenses## yielding significant improvements in both memory and computational efficiency.

34502,,,TAGA: Self-supervised Learning for Template-free Animatable Gaussian Articulated Model,Decoupling from customized parametric templates represents a crucial step toward the creation of fully flexible## animatable articulated models. While existing template-free methods can achieve high-fidelity reconstruction in observed views## they struggle to recover plausible canonical models## resulting in suboptimal animation quality. This limitation stems from overlooking the fundamental ambiguity in canonical reconstruction## where multiple canonical models could explain the same observed views. By revealing the entanglement between the canonical ambiguity and incorrect skinning## we present a self-supervised framework that learns both plausible skinning and accurate canonical geometry using only sparse pose data. Our method## TAGA## uses explicit 3D Gaussians as skinning carriers and characterizes the ambiguity as 'Ambiguous Gaussians' with incorrect skinning weights. TAGA then corrects ambiguous Gaussians in the observation space using anomaly detection. With the corrected ones## we enforce cycle consistency constraints on both geometry and skinning to refine the corresponding Gaussians in the canonical space through a new backward method. Compared to existing state-of-the-art template-free methods## TAGA delivers superior visual fidelity for novel views and poses## while significantly improving training and rendering speeds.

Existing CDFSAR methods mainly focus on joint training of source and target data to mitigate the side effect of domain gap. However## such kind of methods suffer from two limitations: First## pair-wise joint training requires retraining deep models in case of one source data and multiple target ones## which incurs heavy computation cost## especially for large source and small target data. Second## pre-trained models after joint training are adopted to target domain in a straightforward manner## hardly taking full potential of pre-trained models and then limiting recognition performance. To overcome above limitations## this paper proposes a simple yet effective baseline## namely Temporal-Aware Model Tuning (TAMT) for CDFSAR. Specifically## our TAMT involves a decoupled paradigm by performing pre-training on source data and fine-tuning target data## which avoids retraining for multiple target data with single source. To effectively and efficiently explore the potential of pre-trained models in transferring to target domain## our TAMT proposes a Hierarchical Temporal Tuning Network (HTTN)## whose core involves local temporal-aware adapters (TAA) and a global temporal-aware moment tuning (GTMT). Particularly## TAA learns few parameters to recalibrate the intermediate features of frozen pre-trained models## enabling efficient adaptation to target domains. Furthermore## GTMT helps to generate powerful video representations## improving match performance on the target domain. Experiments on several widely used video benchmarks show our TAMT outperforms the recently proposed counterparts by 13% 31%## achieving new state-of-the-art CDFSAR results.,0,0

Although several methods based on pseudo-labeling have been proposed## it remains challenging to effectively and accurately utilize unlabeled data. In this paper## we propose a novel framework called Taste More Taste Better (TMTB)## which emphasizes both data and model aspects.

32998,,,Taxonomy-Aware Evaluation of Vision-Language Models,When a vision-language model (VLM) is prompted to identify an entity depicted in an image## it may answer 'I see a conifer##' rather than the specific label 'Norway spruce'. This raises two issues for evaluation: Firstly## the unconstrained generated text needs to be mapped to the evaluation label space (i.e.## 'conifer'). Secondly## a useful classification measure should give partial credit to less specific## but not incorrect## answers ('Norway spruce' being a type of 'conifer'). To meet these requirements## we propose a framework for evaluating unconstrained text predictions such as those generated from a vision-language model against a taxonomy. Specifically## we propose the use of hierarchical precision and recall measures to assess the level of correctness and specificity of predictions with regard to a taxonomy. Experimentally## we first show that existing text similarity measures do not capture taxonomic similarity well. We then develop and compare different methods to map textual VLM predictions onto a taxonomy. This allows us to compute hierarchical similarity measures between the generated text and the ground truth labels. Finally## we analyze modern VLMs on fine-grained visual classification tasks based on our proposed taxonomic evaluation scheme.,0,0
34854,,2501.11561,Teaching Large Language Models to Regress Accurate Image Quality Scores Using Score Distribution,With the rapid advancement of Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs)## MLLM-based Image Quality Assessment (IQA) methods have shown promising performance in linguistic quality description. However## current methods still fall short in accurately scoring image quality. In this work## we aim to leverage MLLMs to regress accurate quality scores. A key challenge is that the quality score is inherently continuous## typically modeled as a Gaussian distribution## whereas MLLMs generate discrete token outputs. This mismatch necessitates score discretization. Previous approaches discretize the mean score into a one-hot label## resulting in information loss and failing to capture inter-image relationships. We propose a distribution-based approach that discretizes the score distribution into a soft label. This method preserves the characteristics of the score distribution## achieving high accuracy and maintaining inter-image relationships. Moreover## to address dataset variation## where different IQA datasets exhibit various distributions## we introduce a fidelity loss based on Thurstone's model. This loss captures intra-dataset relationships## facilitating co-training across multiple IQA datasets. With these designs## we develop the distribution-based Depicted image Quality Assessment model for Score regression (DeQA-Score). Experiments across multiple benchmarks show that DeQA-Score stably outperforms baselines in score regression. Also## DeQA-Score can predict the score distribution that closely aligns with human annotations. Codes and model weights have been released in https://depictqa.github.io/deqa-score/.,0,0

However## recent improvements in model performance## driven by larger feature extractors and datasets## have led to increased computational demands. This presents a challenge for applications like autonomous driving and robotics## which rely on limited computational resources.

Current solutions primarily rely on supervised detectors## yet lack understanding of why these artifacts occur in the first place. In our analysis## we identify three distinct phases in the diffusion generative process: Profiling## Mutation## and Refinement. Artifacts typically emerge during the Mutation phase## where certain regions exhibit anomalous score dynamics over time## causing abrupt disruptions in the normal evolution pattern. This temporal nature explains why existing methods focusing only on spatial uncertainty of the final output fail at effective artifact localization. Based on these insights## we propose ASCED (Abnormal Score Correction for Enhancing Diffusion)## that detects artifacts by monitoring abnormal score dynamics during the diffusion process## with a trajectory-aware on-the-fly mitigation strategy that appropriate generation of noise in the detected areas.

32766,,,Test-Time Fine-Tuning of Image Compression Models for Multi-Task Adaptability,The field of computer vision was initially inspired by the human visual system and has progressively expanded to include a broader range of machine vision applications. Consequently## image compressors should be designed to effectively accommodate not only human visual perception but also machine vision tasks## including closed-set scenarios that enable pre-training and open-set scenarios that involve previously unseen tasks at test time. Many recent studies effectively address both human visual perception and closed-set machine vision tasks simultaneously but struggle to handle open-set machine vision tasks. To address this issue## this paper proposes a fully instance-specific test time fine-tuning (TTFT) for adapting learned image compression (LIC) to both closed-set and open-set machine vision tasks effectively. With our method## a large-scale LIC model## originally trained for human perception## is adapted to the target task through TTFT using Singular Value Decomposition based Low Rank Adaptation (SVD-LoRA). During TTFT## the decoder adopts a modified learning scheme that focuses exclusively on training the singular values## which helps prevent excessive bitstream overhead.

33348,,2411.19654,TexGaussian: Generating High-quality PBR Material via Octree-based 3D Gaussian Splatting,Physically Based Rendering (PBR) materials play a crucial role in modern graphics## enabling photorealistic rendering across diverse environment maps. Developing an effective and efficient algorithm that is capable of automatically generating high-quality PBR materials rather than RGB texture for 3D meshes can significantly streamline the 3D content creation. Most existing methods leverage pre-trained 2D diffusion models for multi-view image synthesis## which often leads to severe inconsistency between the generated textures and input 3D meshes.

33378,,,Text Augmented Correlation Transformer For Few-shot Classification & Segmentation,Foundation models like CLIP and ALIGN have transformed few-shot and zero-shot vision applications by fusing visual and textual data## yet the integrative few-shot classification and segmentation (FS-CS) task primarily leverages visual cues## overlooking the potential of textual support. In FS-CS scenarios## ambiguous object boundaries and overlapping classes often hinder model performance## as limited visual data struggles to fully capture high-level semantics. To bridge this gap## we present a novel multi-modal FS-CS framework that integrates textual cues into support data## facilitating enhanced semantic disambiguation and fine-grained segmentation. Our approach first investigates the unique contributions of exclusive text-based support## using only class labels to achieve FS-CS. This strategy alone achieves performance competitive with vision-only methods on FS-CS tasks## underscoring the power of textual cues in few-shot learning. Building on this## we introduce a dual-modal prediction mechanism that synthesizes insights from both textual and visual support sets## yielding robust multi-modal predictions. This integration significantly elevates FS-CS performance## with classification and segmentation improvements of +3.7/6.6% (1-way 1-shot) and +8.0/6.5% (2-way 1-shot) on COCO-20^i## and +2.2/3.8% (1-way 1-shot) and +4.3/4.0% (2-way 1-shot) on Pascal-5^i.

34195,,2411.15236,Text Embedding is Not All You Need: Attention Control for Text-to-Image Semantic Alignment with Text Self-Attention Maps,In text-to-image diffusion models## the cross-attention map of each text token indicates the specific image regions attended. Comparing these maps of syntactically related tokens provides insights into how well the generated image reflects the text prompt. For example## in the prompt## 'a black car and a white clock'## the cross-attention maps for 'black' and 'car' should focus on overlapping regions to depict a black car## while 'car' and 'clock' should not. Incorrect overlapping in the maps generally produces generation flaws such as missing objects and incorrect attribute binding. Our study makes the key observations investigating this issue in the existing text-to-image models: (1) the similarity in text embeddings between different tokens---used as conditioning inputs---can cause their cross-attention maps to focus on the same image regions; and (2) text embeddings often fail to faithfully capture syntactic relations already within text attention maps. As a result## such syntactic relationships can be overlooked in cross-attention module## leading to inaccurate image generation. To address this## we propose a method that directly transfers syntactic relations from the text attention maps to the cross-attention module via a test-time optimization. Our approach leverages this inherent yet unexploited information within text attention maps to enhance image-text semantic alignment across diverse prompts## without relying on external guidance.

33709,,2503.11221,Toward Generalized Image Quality Assessment: Relaxing the Perfect Reference Quality Assumption,Full-reference image quality assessment (FR-IQA) generally assumes that reference images are of perfect quality. However## this assumption is flawed due to the sensor and optical limitations of modern imaging systems. Moreover## recent generative enhancement methods are capable of producing images of higher quality than their original. All of these challenge the effectiveness and applicability of current FR-IQA models. To relax the assumption of perfect reference image quality## we build a large-scale IQA database## namely DiffIQA## containing approximately 180##000 images generated by a diffusion-based image enhancer with adjustable hyper-parameters. Each image is annotated by human subjects as either worse## similar## or better quality compared to its reference. Building on this## we present a generalized FR-IQA model## namely Adaptive FIdelity-Naturalness Evaluator (A-FINE)## to accurately assess and adaptively combine the fidelity and naturalness of a test image. A-FINE aligns well with standard FR-IQA when the reference image is much more natural than the test image. We demonstrate by extensive experiments that A-FINE surpasses standard FR-IQA models on well-established IQA datasets and our newly created DiffIQA. To further validate A-FINE## we additionally construct a super-resolution IQA benchmark (SRIQA-Bench)## encompassing test images derived from ten state-of-the-art SR methods with reliable human quality annotations. Tests on SRIQA-Bench re-affirm the advantages of A-FINE. The code and dataset are available at https://tianhewu.github.io/A-FINE-page.github.io/.,0,0

35241,,2503.11240,Towards Better Alignment: Training Diffusion Models with Reinforcement Learning Against Sparse Rewards,Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-image generation. However## their practical applications are hindered by the misalignment between generated images and corresponding text prompts. To tackle this issue## reinforcement learning (RL) has been considered for diffusion model fine-tuning. Yet## RL's effectiveness is limited by the challenge of sparse reward## where feedback is only available at the end of the generation process. This makes it difficult to identify which actions during the denoising process contribute positively to the final generated image## potentially leading to ineffective or unnecessary denoising policies. To this end## this paper presents a novel RL-based framework that addresses the sparse reward problem when training diffusion models. Our framework## named \text B ^2\text -DiffuRL ## employs two strategies: **B**ackward progressive training and **B**ranch-based sampling. For one thing## backward progressive training focuses initially on the final timesteps of the denoising process and gradually extends the training interval to earlier timesteps## easing the learning difficulty associated with sparse rewards. For another## we perform branch-based sampling for each training interval. By comparing the samples within the same branch## we can identify how much the policies of the current training interval contribute to the final image## which helps to learn effective policies instead of unnecessary ones. \text B ^2\text -DiffuRL  is compatible with existing optimization algorithms. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of \text B ^2\text -DiffuRL  in improving prompt-image alignment and maintaining diversity in generated images.

However## gradient conflicts from different tasks remain a major challenge in MTL. Previous gradient-based and loss-based methods primarily focus on gradient optimization in shared parameters## often overlooking the potential of task-specific parameters. This work points out that task-specific parameters not only capture task-specific information but also influence the gradients propagated to shared parameters## which in turn affects gradient conflicts.

32720,,2503.03272,Towards Effective and Sparse Adversarial Attack on Spiking Neural Networks via Breaking Invisible Surrogate Gradients,Spiking neural networks (SNNs) have shown their competence in handling spatial-temporal event-based data with low energy consumption. Similar to conventional artificial neural networks (ANNs)## SNNs are also vulnerable to gradient-based adversarial attacks## wherein gradients are calculated by spatial-temporal back-propagation (STBP) and surrogate gradients (SGs). However## the SGs may be invisible for an inference-only model as they do not influence the inference results## and current gradient-based attacks are ineffective for binary dynamic images captured by the dynamic vision sensor (DVS). While some approaches addressed the issue of invisible SGs through universal SGs## their SGs lack a correlation with the victim model## resulting in sub-optimal performance. Moreover## the imperceptibility of existing SNN-based binary attacks is still insufficient. In this paper## we introduce an innovative potential-dependent surrogate gradient (PDSG) method to establish a robust connection between the SG and the model## thereby enhancing the adaptability of adversarial attacks across various models with invisible SGs. Additionally## we propose the sparse dynamic attack (SDA) to effectively attack binary dynamic images. Utilizing a generation-reduction paradigm## SDA can fully optimize the sparsity of adversarial perturbations. Experimental results demonstrate that our PDSG and SDA outperform state-of-the-art SNN-based attacks across various models and datasets.

35187,,2312.04831,Towards Enhanced Image Inpainting: Mitigating Unwanted Object Insertion and Preserving Color Consistency,Recent advances in image inpainting increasingly use generative models to handle large irregular masks. However## these models can create unrealistic inpainted images due to two main issues: (1) Unwanted object insertion: Even with unmasked areas as context## generative models may still generate arbitrary objects in the masked region that don't align with the rest of the image. (2) Color inconsistency: Inpainted regions often have color shifts that causes a smeared appearance## reducing image quality. Retraining the generative model could help solve these issues## but it's costly since state-of-the-art latent-based diffusion and rectified flow models require a three-stage training process: training a VAE## training a generative U-Net or transformer## and fine-tuning for inpainting. Instead## this paper proposes a post-processing approach## dubbed as ASUKA (Aligned Stable inpainting with UnKnown Areas prior)## to improve inpainting models. To address unwanted object insertion## we leverage a Masked Auto-Encoder (MAE) for reconstruction-based priors. This mitigates object hallucination while maintaining the model's generation capabilities. To address color inconsistency## we propose a specialized VAE decoder that treats latent-to-image decoding as a local harmonization task## significantly reducing color shifts for color-consistent inpainting. We validate ASUKA on SD 1.5 and FLUX inpainting variants with Places2 and MISATO## our proposed diverse collection of datasets.

We introduce the AODRaw dataset## which offers 7##785 high-resolution real RAW images with 135##601 annotated instances spanning 62 categories## capturing a broad range of indoor and outdoor scenes under 9 distinct light and weather conditions. Based on AODRaw that supports RAW and sRGB object detection## we provide a comprehensive benchmark for evaluating current detection methods. We find that sRGB pre-training constrains the potential of RAW object detection due to the domain gap between sRGB and RAW## prompting us to directly pre-train on the RAW domain.  However## it is harder for RAW pre-training to learn rich representations than sRGB pre-training due to the camera noise. To assist RAW pre-training## we distill the knowledge from an off-the-shelf model pre-trained on the sRGB domain.

Previous works mostly focus on shape composition## making them very hard to use for realistic composition of 3D objects captured from real-world scenes. This leads to combining multiple NeRFs into a single 3D scene to achieve seamless appearance blending. However## the current SeamlessNeRF method struggles to achieve interactive editing and harmonious stitching for real-world scenes due to its gradient-based strategy and grid-based representation. To this end## we present an example-based modeling method that combines multiple Gaussian fields in a point-based representation using sample-guided synthesis. Specifically## as for composition## we create a GUI to segment and transform multiple fields in real time## easily obtaining a semantically meaningful composition of models represented by 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). For texture blending## due to the discrete and irregular nature of 3DGS## straightforwardly applying gradient propagation as SeamlssNeRF is not supported. Thus## a novel sampling-based cloning method is proposed to harmonize the blending while preserving the original rich texture and content. Our workflow consists of three steps: 1) real-time segmentation and transformation of a Gaussian model using a well-tailored GUI## 2) KNN analysis to identify boundary points in the intersecting area between the source and target models## and 3) two-phase optimization of the target model using sampling-based cloning and gradient constraints.

35260,,,UNIALIGN: Scaling Multimodal Alignment within One Unified Model,We present UNIALIGN## a unified model to align an arbitrary number of modalities (\text e.g. ## image## text## audio## 3D point cloud## etc.) through one  encoder and a single training phase. Existing solutions typically employ distinct encoders for each modality## resulting in increased parameters as the number of modalities grows. In contrast## UNIALIGN proposes a modality-aware adaptation of the powerful mixture-of-experts (MoE) schema and further integrates it with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)##  efficiently scaling the encoder to accommodate inputs in diverse modalities while maintaining a fixed computational overhead.Moreover## prior work often requires separate training for each extended modality. This leads to task-specific models and further hinders the communication between modalities.To address this## we propose a soft modality binding strategy that aligns all modalities using unpaired data samples across datasets. Two additional training objectives are introduced to distill knowledge from well-aligned anchor modalities and prior multimodal models## elevating UNIALIGN into a high performance multimodal foundation model.Experiments on 11 benchmarks across 6 different modalities demonstrate that UNIALIGN could achieve comparable performance to SOTA approaches## while using merely 7.8M trainable parameters and maintaining an identical model with the same weight across all tasks.

34307,,,UNIC-Adapter: Unified Image-instruction Adapter with Multi-modal Transformer for Image Generation,Recently## text-to-image generation models have achieved remarkable advancements## particularly with diffusion models facilitating high-quality image synthesis from textual descriptions. However## these models often struggle with achieving precise control over pixel-level layouts## object appearances## and global styles when using text prompts alone. To mitigate this issue## previous works introduce conditional images as auxiliary inputs for image generation## enhancing control but typically necessitating specialized models tailored to different types of reference inputs. In this paper## we explore a new approach to unify controllable generation within a single framework. Specifically## we propose the unified image-instruction adapter (UNIC-Adapter) built on the Multi-Modal-Diffusion Transformer architecture## to enable flexible and controllable generation across diverse conditions without the need for multiple specialized models. Our UNIC-Adapter effectively extracts multi-modal instruction information by incorporating both conditional images and task instructions## injecting this information into the image generation process through a cross-attention mechanism enhanced by Rotary Position Embedding.

33686,,,UNICL-SAM: Uncertainty-Driven In-Context Segmentation with Part Prototype Discovery,Recent advancements in in-context segmentation generalists have demonstrated significant success in performing various image segmentation tasks using a limited number of labeled example images. However## real-world applications present challenges due to the variability of support examples## which often exhibit quality issues resulting from various sources and inaccurate labeling. How to extract more robust representations from these examples has always been one of the goals of in-context visual learning. In response## we propose UNICL-SAM## to better model the example distribution and extract robust representations to help in-context segmentation. We incorporate an uncertainty probabilistic module to quantify each example's reliability during both the training and testing phases. Utilizing this uncertainty estimation## we introduce an uncertainty-guided graph augmentation and feature refinement strategy## aimed at mitigating the impact of high-uncertainty regions to enhance the learning of robust representations. Subsequently## we construct prototypes for each example by aggregating part information## thereby creating reliable in-context instruction that effectively represents fine-grained local semantics.

33952,,,UNOPose: Unseen Object Pose Estimation with an Unposed RGB-D Reference Image,Unseen object pose estimation methods often rely on CAD models or multiple reference views## making the onboarding stage costly. To simplify reference acquisition## we aim to estimate the unseen object's pose through a single unposed RGB-D reference image. While previous works leverage reference images as pose anchors to limit the range of relative pose## our scenario presents significant challenges since the relative transformation could vary across the entire SE(3) space. Moreover## factors like occlusion## sensor noise## and extreme geometry could result in low viewpoint overlap. To address these challenges## we present a novel approach and benchmark## termed UNOPose## for UNseen One-reference-based object Pose estimation. Building upon a coarse-to-fine paradigm##  UNOPose constructs an SE(3)-invariant reference frame to standardize object representation despite pose and size variations. To alleviate small overlap across viewpoints## we recalibrate the weight of each correspondence based on its predicted likelihood of being within the overlapping region. Evaluated on our proposed benchmark based on the BOP Challenge## UNOPose demonstrates superior performance## significantly outperforming traditional and learning-based methods in the one-reference setting and remaining competitive with CAD-model-based methods.

Additionally## we introduce the vision-language scoring system to mitigate the bias issues## which focuses on three aspects: (i) response correctness; (ii) the model capability of visual understanding and reasoning; (iii) relevance of text-image matching. Experimental results demonstrate that UPME achieves a Pearson correlation of 0.944 with human evaluations on the MMstar dataset and 0.814 on the ScienceQA dataset## indicating that our UPME framework closely aligns with human-designed QA benchmarks and inherent human preferences.,0,0

34321,,,USP-Gaussian: Unifying Spike-based Image Reconstruction## Pose Correction and Gaussian Splatting,Spike camera## as an innovative type of neuromorphic camera that captures scenes with 0-1 bit stream at 40 kHz## is increasingly being employed for the novel view synthesis task building on the techniques such as Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF) and 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS). Previous spike-based approaches typically follow a three-stage pipeline: I. Spike-to-image reconstruction based on established algorithms. II. Camera poses estimation. III. Novel view synthesis. However## the cascading framework suffers from substantial cumulative errors## i.e.## the quality of the initially reconstructed images will impact pose estimation## ultimately limiting the fidelity of the 3D reconstruction. To address this limitation## we propose a synergistic optimization framework USP-Gaussian## which unifies spike-to-image reconstruction## pose correction## and gaussian splatting into an end-to-end pipeline. Leveraging the multi-view consistency afforded by 3DGS and the motion capture capability of the spike camera## our framework enables iterative optimization between the spike-to-image reconstruction network and 3DGS. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate that our method surpasses previous approaches by effectively eliminating cascading errors.

33266,,2502.01846,UVGS: Reimagining Unstructured 3D Gaussian Splatting using UV Mapping,3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has demonstrated superior quality in modeling 3D objects and scenes. However## generating 3DGS remains challenging due to their discrete## unstructured## and permutation-invariant nature. In this work## we present a simple yet effective method to overcome these challenges. We utilize spherical mapping to transform 3DGS into a structured 2D representation## termed UVGS. UVGS can be viewed as multi-channel images## with feature dimensions as a concatenation of Gaussian attributes such as position## scale## color## opacity## and rotation. We further find that these heterogeneous features can be compressed into a lower-dimensional (e.g.## 3-channel) shared feature space using a carefully designed multi-branch network.The compressed UVGS can be treated as typical RGB images. Remarkably## we discover that typical VAEs trained with latent diffusion models can directly generalize to this new representation without additional training. Our novel representation makes it effortless to leverage foundational 2D models## such as diffusion models## to directly model 3DGS. Additionally## one can simply increase the 2D UV resolution to accommodate more Gaussians## making UVGS a scalable solution compared to typical 3D backbones. This approach immediately unlocks various novel generation applications of 3DGS by inherently utilizing the already developed superior 2D generation capabilities. In our experiments## we demonstrate various unconditional## conditional generation## and inpainting applications of 3DGS based on diffusion models## which were previously non-trivial.,0,0
33634,,2505.09615,UWAV: Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing,Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) entails the challenging task of localizing both uni-modal events (i.e.## those occurring exclusively in either the visual or acoustic modality of a video) and multi-modal events (i.e.## those occurring in both modalities concurrently). Moreover## the prohibitive cost of annotating training data with the class labels of all these events## along with their start and end times## imposes constraints on the scalability of AVVP techniques unless they can be trained in a weakly-supervised setting## where only modality-agnostic## video-level labels are available in the training data. To this end## recently proposed approaches seek to generate segment-level pseudo-labels to better guide model training. However## the absence of inter-segment dependencies when generating these pseudo-labels and the general bias towards predicting labels that are absent in a segment limit their performance. This work proposes a novel approach towards overcoming these weaknesses called Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-visual Video Parsing (UWAV). Additionally## our innovative approach factors in the uncertainty associated with these estimated pseudo-labels and incorporates a feature mixup based training regularization for improved training.

32470,,2501.11515,UltraFusion: Ultra High Dynamic Imaging using Exposure Fusion,Capturing high dynamic range (HDR) scenes is one of the most important issues in camera design. Majority of cameras use exposure fusion## which fuses images captured by different exposure levels## to increase dynamic range. However## this approach can only handle images with limited exposure difference## normally 3-4 stops. When applying to very high dynamic range scenes where a large exposure difference is required## this approach often fails due to incorrect alignment or inconsistent lighting between inputs## or tone mapping artifacts. In this work## we propose UltraFusion## the first exposure fusion technique that can merge inputs with 9 stops differences. The key idea is that we model exposure fusion as a guided inpainting problem## where the under-exposed image is used as a guidance to fill the missing information of over-exposed highlights in the over-exposed region. Using an under-exposed image as a soft guidance## instead of a hard constraint## our model is robust to potential alignment issue or lighting variations. Moreover## by utilizing the image prior of the generative model## our model also generates natural tone mapping## even for very high-dynamic range scenes. Our approach outperforms HDR-Transformer on latest HDR benchmarks. Moreover## to test its performance in ultra high dynamic range scenes## we capture a new real-world exposure fusion benchmark## UltraFusion dataset## with exposure differences up to 9 stops## and experiments show that UltraFusion can generate beautiful and high-quality fusion results under various scenarios.

Namely## we tackle the problem that current video benchmarks may suffer from different representation biases## e.g.## object bias or single-frame bias## where mere recognition of objects or utilization of only a single frame is sufficient for correct prediction. We leverage VLMs and LLMs to analyze and debias benchmarks from such representation biases. Specifically## we generate frame-wise textual descriptions of videos## filter them for specific information (e.g. only objects) and leverage them to examine representation biases across three dimensions: 1) concept bias -- determining if a specific concept (e.g.## objects) alone suffice for prediction; 2) temporal bias -- assessing if temporal information contributes to prediction; and 3) common sense vs. dataset bias -- evaluating whether zero-shot reasoning or dataset correlations contribute to prediction. We conduct a systematic analysis of 12 popular video classification and retrieval datasets and create new object-debiased test splits for these datasets. Moreover## we benchmark 30 state-of-the-art video models on original and debiased splits and analyze biases in the models. To facilitate the future development of more robust video understanding benchmarks and models## we release: 'UTD-descriptions'## a dataset with our rich structured descriptions for each dataset## and 'UTD-splits'## a dataset of object-debiased test splits.,0,0
34022,,,Unboxed: Geometrically and Temporally Consistent Video Outpainting,Extending the field of view of video content beyond its original version has many applications: immersive viewing experience with VR devices## reformatting 4:3 legacy content to today's viewing conditions with wide screens## or simply extending vertically captured phone videos. Many existing works focus on synthesizing the video using generative models only. Despite promising results## this strategy seems at the moment limited in terms of quality. In this work## we address this problem using two key ideas: 3D supported outpainting for the static regions of the images## and leveraging pre-trained video diffusion model to ensure realistic and temporally coherent results## particularly for the dynamic parts. In the first stage## we iterate between image outpainting and updating the 3D scene representation - we use 3D Gaussian Splatting. Then we consider dynamic objects independently per frame and inpaint missing pixels. Finally## we propose a denoising scheme that allows to maintain known reliable regions and update the dynamic parts to obtain temporally realistic results.We achieve state-of-the-art video outpainting. This is validated quantitatively and through a user study. We are also able to extend the field of view largely beyond the limits reached by existing methods.,0,0
32718,,,Uncertain Multimodal Intention and Emotion Understanding in the Wild,Understanding intention and emotion from social media poses unique challenges due to the inherent uncertainty in multimodal data## where posts often contain incomplete or missing modalities. While this uncertainty reflects real-world scenarios## it remains underexplored within the computer vision community## particularly in conjunction with the intrinsic relationship between emotion and intention.

However## its application in indoor environments remains unexplored. Compared to outdoor 3D datasets## indoor datasets face significant challenges## including fewer training samples per class## a greater number of classes## more severe class imbalance## and more diverse scene types and intra-class variances.This paper presents the first study on active learning for indoor 3D object detection## where we propose a novel framework tailored for this task. Our method incorporates two key criteria - uncertainty and diversity - to actively select the most ambiguous and informative unlabeled samples for annotation. The uncertainty criterion accounts for both inaccurate detections and undetected objects## ensuring that the most ambiguous samples are prioritized. Meanwhile## the diversity criterion is formulated as a joint optimization problem that maximizes the diversity of both object class distributions and scene types## using a new Class-aware Adaptive Prototype (CAP) bank. The CAP bank dynamically allocates representative prototypes to each class## helping to capture varying intra-class diversity across different categories.We evaluate our method on SUN RGB-D and ScanNetV2## where it outperforms baselines by a significant margin## achieving over 85% of fully-supervised performance with just 10% of the annotation budget.,0,0
32877,,2503.22725,Uncertainty Weighted Gradients for Model Calibration,Model calibration is essential for ensuring that the predictions of deep neural networks accurately reflect true probabilities in real-world classification tasks.

Various methods have been proposed to address this issue by designing effective loss functions for calibration## such as focal loss. In this paper## we analyze its effectiveness and provide a unified loss framework of focal loss and its variants## where we mainly attribute their superiority in model calibration to the loss weighting factor that estimates sample-wise uncertainty. Based on our analysis## existing loss functions fail to achieve optimal calibration performance due to two main issues: including misalignment during optimization and insufficient precision in uncertainty estimation. Specifically## focal loss cannot align sample uncertainty with gradient scaling and the single logit cannot indicate the uncertainty. To address these issues## we reformulate the optimization from the perspective of gradients## which focuses on uncertain samples. Meanwhile## we propose using the Brier Score as the loss weight factor## which provides a more accurate uncertainty estimation via all the logits.

32638,,2503.18512,Uncertainty-guided Perturbation for Image Super-Resolution Diffusion Model,Diffusion-based image super-resolution methods have demonstrated significant advantages over GAN-based approaches## particularly in terms of perceptual quality. Building upon a lengthy Markov chain## diffusion-based methods possess remarkable modeling capacity## enabling them to achieve outstanding performance in real-world scenarios. Unlike previous methods that focus on modifying the noise schedule or sampling process to enhance performance## our approach emphasizes the improved utilization of LR information. We find that different regions of the LR image can be viewed as corresponding to different timesteps in a diffusion process## where flat areas are closer to the target HR distribution but edge and texture regions are farther away. In these flat areas## applying a slight noise is more advantageous for the reconstruction. We associate this characteristic with uncertainty and propose to apply uncertainty estimate to guide region-specific noise level control## a technique we refer to as Uncertainty-guided Noise Weighting. Pixels with lower uncertainty (i.e.## flat regions) receive reduced noise to preserve more LR information## therefore improving performance. Furthermore## we modify the network architecture of previous methods to develop our Uncertainty-guided Perturbation Super-Resolution (UPSR) model.

33984,,,Understanding Fine-tuning CLIP for Open-vocabulary Semantic Segmentation in Hyperbolic Space,CLIP## a foundational vision-language model## has emerged as a powerful tool for open-vocabulary semantic segmentation. While freezing the text encoder preserves its powerful embeddings## recent studies show that fine-tuning both the text and image encoders jointly significantly enhances segmentation performance## especially for classes from open sets. In this work## we explain this phenomenon from the perspective of hierarchical alignment## since during fine-tuning## the hierarchy level of image embeddings shifts from image-level to pixel-level. We achieve this by leveraging hyperbolic space## which naturally encoders hierarchical structures. Our key observation is that## during fine-tuning## the hyperbolic radius of CLIP's text embeddings decreases## facilitating better alignment with the pixel-level hierarchical structure of visual data. Building on this insight## we propose HyperCLIP## a novel fine-tuning strategy that adjusts the hyperbolic radius of the text embeddings through scaling transformations. By doing so## HyperCLIP equips CLIP with segmentation capability while introducing only a small number of learnable parameters. Our experiments demonstrate that HyperCLIP achieves state-of-the-art performance on open-vocabulary semantic segmentation tasks across three benchmarks## while fine-tuning only approximately 4% of the total parameters of CLIP. More importantly## we observe that after adjustment## CLIP's text embeddings exhibit a relatively fixed hyperbolic radius across datasets## suggesting that the segmentation task has a characteristic level in hyperbolic space.,0,0

However## the spatial structure of 3D voxels will be inevitably destroyed during the serialization process. Besides## due to the considerable number of 3D voxels and quadratic complexity of Transformers## multiple sequences are grouped before feeding to Transformers## leading to a limited receptive field. Inspired by the impressive performance of State Space Models (SSM)## in this paper## we propose a novel Unified Mamba (UniMamba)## which seamlessly integrates the merits of 3D convolution and SSM in a concise multi-head manner## aiming to perform 'local and global' spatial context aggregation efficiently and simultaneously. Specifically## a UniMamba block is designed which mainly consists of spatial locality modeling## complementary Z-order serialization and local-global sequential aggregator. The spatial locality modeling module integrates 3D submanifold convolution to capture the dynamic spatial position embedding before serialization. Then the efficient Z-order curve is adopted for serialization both horizontally and vertically. Furthermore## the local-global sequential aggregator adopts the channel grouping strategy to efficiently encode both 'local and global' spatial inter-dependencies using multi-head SSM. Additionally## an encoder-decoder architecture with stacked UniMamba blocks is formed to facilitate multi-scale spatial learning hierarchically. Extensive experiments are conducted on three popular datasets: nuScenes## Waymo and Argoverse 2. Particularly## our UniMamba achieves 70.2 mAP on the nuScenes dataset.,0,0

34536,,2505.22458,Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation,Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled synthetic data (source) to unlabeled real-world data (target). Traditional UDA-SS methods work on the assumption that the category settings between the source and target domains are known in advance. However## in real-world scenarios## the category settings of the source and target are unknown due to the lack of labels in the target## resulting in the existence of target-private or source-private classes. Traditional UDA-SS methods struggle with this change## leading to negative transfer and performance degradation. To address these issues## we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS) for the first time to achieve good performance even when the category settings of source and target are unknown. We defined the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as that the confidence score of common Unsupervised domain adaptation for semantic segmentation (UDA-SS) aims to transfer knowledge from labeled source data to unlabeled target data. However## traditional UDA-SS methods assume that category settings between source and target domains are known## which is unrealistic in real-world scenarios. This leads to performance degradation if private private classes exist. To address this limitation## we propose Universal Domain Adaptation for Semantic Segmentation (UniDA-SS)## achieving robust adaptation even without prior knowledge of category settings. We define the problem in the UniDA-SS scenario as low confidence scores of common classes in the target domain## which leads to confusion with private classes. To solve this problem## we propose UniMAP: UniDA-SS with Image Ma tching and Prototype-based Distinction## a novel framework composed of two key components. First## Domain-Specific Prototype-based Distinction (DSPD) divides each class into two domain-specific prototypes## enabling finer separation of domain-specific features and enhancing the identification of common classes across domains. Second## Target-based Image Matching (TIM) selects a source image containing the most common-class pixels based on the target pseudo-label and pairs it in a batch to promote effective learning of common classes. We also introduce a new UniDA-SS benchmark and demonstrate through various experiments that UniMAP significantly outperforms baselines.

35181,,2411.15843,Unveil Inversion and Invariance in Flow Transformer for Versatile Image Editing,Leveraging the large generative prior of the flow transformer for tuning-free image editing requires authentic inversion to project the image into the model's domain and a flexible invariance control mechanism to preserve non-target contents. However## the prevailing diffusion inversion performs deficiently in flow-based models## and the invariance control cannot reconcile diverse rigid and non-rigid editing tasks. To address these## we systematically analyze the inversion and invariance control based on the flow transformer. Specifically## we unveil that the Euler inversion shares a similar structure to DDIM yet is more susceptible to the approximation error. Thus## we propose a two-stage inversion to first refine the velocity estimation and then compensate for the leftover error## which pivots closely to the model prior and benefits editing. Meanwhile## we propose the invariance control that manipulates the text features within the adaptive layer normalization## connecting the changes in the text prompt to image semantics. This mechanism can simultaneously preserve the non-target contents while allowing rigid and non-rigid manipulation## enabling a wide range of editing types. Experiments on various scenarios demonstrate that our framework achieves flexible and accurate editing## unlocking the potential of the flow transformer for versatile image editing.,0,0
34419,,,Unveiling Differences in Generative Models: A Scalable Differential Clustering Approach,A fine-grained comparison of generative models requires the identification of sample types generated differently by each of the involved models. While quantitative scores have been proposed in the literature to rank different generative models## score-based evaluation and ranking do not reveal the nuanced differences between the generative models in producing different sample types. In this work## we propose solving a differential clustering problem to detect sample types generated differently by two generative models. To solve the differential clustering problem## we develop a spectral method called Fourier-based Identification of Novel Clusters (FINC) to identify modes produced by a generative model with a higher frequency in comparison to a reference distribution. FINC provides a scalable algorithm based on random Fourier features to estimate the eigenspace of kernel covariance matrices of two generative models and utilize the principal eigendirections to detect the sample types present more dominantly in each model. We demonstrate the application of the FINC method to large-scale computer vision datasets and generative modeling frameworks. Our numerical results suggest the scalability of the developed Fourier-based method in highlighting the sample types produced with different frequencies by generative models.

This impressive leap raises a compelling question: how can language models## initially trained solely on linguistic data## effectively interpret and process visual content? This paper aims to address this question with systematic investigation across 4 model families and 4 model scales## uncovering a unique class of attention heads that focus specifically on visual content. Our analysis reveals a strong correlation between the behavior of these attention heads## the distribution of attention weights## and their concentration on visual tokens within the input.

However## we reveal that MLLMs often generate incorrect answers even when they understand the visual content. To this end## we manually construct a benchmark with 12 categories and design evaluation metrics that assess the degree of error in MLLM responses even when the visual content is seemingly understood. Based on this benchmark## we test 15 leading MLLMs and analyze the distribution of attention maps and logits of some MLLMs. Our investigation identifies two primary issues: 1) most instruction tuning datasets predominantly feature questions that 'directly' relate to the visual content## leading to a bias in MLLMs' responses to other indirect questions## and 2) MLLMs' attention to visual tokens is notably lower than to system and question tokens. We further observe that attention scores between questions and visual tokens as well as the model's confidence in the answers are lower in response to misleading questions than to straightforward ones. To address the first challenge## we introduce a paired positive and negative data construction pipeline to diversify the dataset. For the second challenge## we propose to enhance the model's focus on visual content during decoding by refining the text and visual prompt. For the text prompt## we propose a content-guided refinement strategy that performs preliminary visual content analysis to generate structured information before answering the question. Additionally## we employ a visual attention refinement strategy that highlights question-relevant visual tokens to increase the model's attention to visual content that aligns with the question.

This mist persists due to three key limitations. First## flawed test data## like ambiguous referential text in the grounding task## can yield incorrect and unreliable test results. Second## oversimplified metrics such as simply averaging accuracy per question answering (QA) pair## cannot reveal true model capability due to their vulnerability to language variations. Third## existing benchmarks isolate the grounding and QA tasks## disregarding the underlying coherence that QA should be based on solid grounding capabilities. To unveil the 'mist'## we propose Beacon3D## a benchmark for 3D-VL grounding and QA tasks## delivering a perspective shift in the evaluation of 3D-VL understanding. Beacon3D features (i) high-quality test data with precise and natural language## (ii) object-centric evaluation with multiple tests per object to ensure robustness## and (iii) a novel chain-of-analysis paradigm to address language robustness and model performance coherence across grounding and QA. Our evaluation of state-of-the-art 3D-VL models on Beacon3D reveals that (i) object-centric evaluation elicits true model performance and particularly weak generalization in QA; (ii) grounding-QA coherence remains fragile in current 3D-VL models## and (iii) incorporating large language models (LLMs) to 3D-VL models## though as a prevalent practice## hinders grounding capabilities and has yet to elevate QA capabilities.

While handcrafted CAD models provide flexible controllability## free CAD libraries often lack the high-quality materials necessary for photorealistic rendering. Conversely## reconstructed 3D models offer high-fidelity rendering but lack controllability. In this work## we introduce UrbanCAD## a framework that generates highly controllable and photorealistic 3D vehicle digital twins from a single urban image## leveraging a large collection of free 3D CAD models and handcrafted materials.

Furthermore## given multi-view background perspective and fisheye images## we approximate environment lighting using fisheye images and reconstruct the background with 3DGS## enabling the photorealistic insertion of optimized CAD models into rendered novel view backgrounds. Experimental results demonstrate that UrbanCAD outperforms baselines in terms of photorealism. Additionally## we show that various perception models maintain their accuracy when evaluated on UrbanCAD with in-distribution configurations but degrade when applied to realistic out-of-distribution data generated by our method.

34272,,2412.04623,Using Diffusion Priors for Video Amodal Segmentation,Object permanence in humans is a fundamental cue that helps in understanding persistence of objects## even when they are fully occluded in the scene. Present day methods in object segmentation do not account for this amodal nature of the world## and only work for segmentation of visible or modal objects. Few amodal methods exist; single-image segmentation methods cannot handle high-levels of occlusions which are better inferred using temporal information## and multi-frame methods have focused solely on segmenting rigid objects. To this end## we propose to tackle video amodal segmentation by formulating it as a conditional generation task## thereby capitalizing on the foundational knowledge in video generative models. Our method is simple; we repurpose these models to condition on a sequence of modal mask frames of an object along with contextual depth maps## to learn which object boundary may be occluded and therefore## extended to hallucinate the complete extent of an object. This is followed by a content completion stage which is able to inpaint the occluded regions of an object. We benchmark our approach alongside a wide array of state-of-the-art methods on four datasets and show a dramatic improvement of upto 13% for amodal segmentation in an object's occluded region.,0,0
34025,,2503.08429,Using Powerful Prior Knowledge of Diffusion Model in Deep Unfolding Networks for Image Compressive Sensing,Recently## Deep Unfolding Networks (DUNs) have achieved impressive reconstruction quality in the field of image Compressive Sensing (CS) by unfolding iterative optimization algorithms into neural networks. The reconstruction quality of DUNs depends on the learned prior knowledge## so introducing stronger prior knowledge can further improve reconstruction quality. On the other hand## pre-trained diffusion models contain powerful prior knowledge and have a solid theoretical foundation and strong scalability## but it requires a large number of iterative steps to achieve reconstruction. In this paper## we propose to use the powerful prior knowledge of pre-trained diffusion model in DUNs to achieve high-quality reconstruction with less steps for image CS. Specifically## we first design an iterative optimization algorithm named Diffusion Message Passing (DMP)## which embeds a pre-trained diffusion model into each iteration process of DMP. Then## we deeply unfold the DMP algorithm into a neural network named DMP-DUN. The proposed DMP-DUN can use lightweight neural networks to achieve mapping from measurement data to the intermediate steps of the reverse diffusion process and directly approximate the divergence of the diffusion model## thereby further improving reconstruction efficiency.

To alleviate VH## various decoding strategies have been proposed to enhance visual information. However## many of these methods may require secondary decoding and rollback## which significantly reduces inference speed. In this work## we propose an efficient plug-and-play decoding algorithm via Visual-Aware Sparsification (VASparse) from the perspective of token sparsity for mitigating VH. VASparse is inspired by empirical observations: (1) the sparse activation of attention in LVLMs## and (2) visual-agnostic tokens sparsification exacerbates VH. Based on these insights## we propose a novel token sparsification strategy that balances efficiency and trustworthiness.  Specifically## VASparse implements a visual-aware token selection strategy during decoding to reduce redundant tokens while preserving visual context effectively.  Additionally## we innovatively introduce a sparse-based visual contrastive decoding method to recalibrate the distribution of hallucinated outputs without the time overhead associated with secondary decoding. Subsequently## VASparse recalibrates attention scores to penalize attention sinking of LVLMs towards text tokens. Extensive experiments across four popular benchmarks confirm the effectiveness of VASparse in mitigating VH across different LVLM families without requiring additional training or post-processing.

To address these challenges in explainable VAD## we introduce a verbalized learning framework named VERA that enables VLMs to perform  VAD without model parameter modifications. Specifically## VERA automatically decomposes the complex reasoning required for VAD into reflections on simpler## more focused guiding questions capturing distinct abnormal patterns. It treats these reflective questions as learnable parameters and optimizes them through data-driven verbal interactions between learner and optimizer VLMs## using coarsely labeled training data.

33276,,,VILA-M3: Enhancing Vision-Language Models with Medical Expert Knowledge,Generalist vision language models (VLMs) have made significant strides in computer vision## but they fall short in specialized fields like healthcare## where expert knowledge is essential. Current large multimodal models like Gemini and GPT-4o are insufficient for medical tasks due to their reliance on memorized internet knowledge rather than the nuanced expertise required in healthcare. Meanwhile## existing medical VLMs (e.g. Med-Gemini) often lack expert consultation as part of their design## and many rely on outdated## static datasets that were not created with modern## large deep learning models in mind. VLMs are usually trained in three stages: vision pre-training## vision-language pre-training## and instruction fine-tuning (IFT). IFT has been typically applied using a mixture of generic and healthcare data. In contrast## we propose that for medical VLMs## a fourth stage of specialized IFT is necessary## which focuses on medical data and includes information from domain expert models. Domain expert models developed for medical use are crucial because they are specifically trained for certain clinical tasks## e.g. to detect tumors and classify abnormalities through segmentation and classification## which learn fine-grained features of medical data-features that are often too intricate for a VLM to capture effectively. This paper introduces a new framework## VILA-M3## for medical VLMs that utilizes domain knowledge via expert models. We argue that generic VLM architectures alone are not viable for real-world clinical applications and on-demand usage of domain-specialized expert model knowledge is critical for advancing AI in healthcare.

32944,,,VLMs-Guided Representation Distillation for Efficient Vision-Based Reinforcement Learning,Vision-based Reinforcement Learning (VRL) attempts to establish associations between visual inputs and optimal actions through interactions with the environment. Given the high-dimensional and complex nature of visual data## it becomes essential to learn policy upon high-quality state representation. To this end## existing VRL methods primarily rely on interaction-collected data## combined with self-supervised auxiliary tasks. However## two key challenges remain: limited data samples and a lack of task-relevant semantic constraints. To tackle this## we propose DGC## a method that distills guidance from Visual Language Models (VLMs) alongside self-supervised learning into a compact VRL agent. Notably## we leverage the state representation capabilities of VLMs## rather than their decision-making abilities. Within DGC## a novel prompting-reasoning pipeline is designed to convert historical observations and actions into usable supervision signals## enabling semantic understanding within the compact visual encoder. By leveraging these distilled semantic representations## the VRL agent achieves significant improvements in the sample efficiency.

The human skeleton plays a critical role in sign language recognition due to its good separation from the video background.

35054,,,Vid2Avatar-Pro: Authentic Avatar from Videos in the Wild via Universal Prior,We present Vid2Avatar-Pro## a method to create photorealistic and animatable 3D human avatars from monocular in-the-wild videos. Building a high-quality avatar that supports animation with diverse poses from a monocular video is challenging because the observation of pose diversity and view points is inherently limited. The lack of pose variations typically leads to poor generalization to novel poses## and avatars can easily overfit to limited input view points## producing artifacts and distortions from other views. In this work## we address these limitations by leveraging a universal prior model (UPM) learned from a large corpus of multi-view clothed human performance capture data.

Once the UPM is learned to accurately reproduce the large-scale multi-view human images## we fine-tune the model with an in-the-wild video via inverse rendering to obtain a personalized photorealistic human avatar that can be faithfully animated to novel human motions and rendered from novel views.

Efforts to enhance MLLMs## such as incorporating point cloud features## have been made## yet a considerable gap remains between the models' learned representations and the inherent complexity of 3D scenes. This discrepancy largely stems from the training of MLLMs on predominantly 2D data## which restricts their effectiveness in comprehending 3D spaces. To address this issue## in this paper## we propose a novel generalist model## i.e.## Video-3D LLM## for 3D scene understanding. By treating 3D scenes as dynamic videos and incorporating 3D position encoding into these representations## our Video-3D LLM aligns video representations with real-world spatial contexts more accurately. In addition## we have implemented a maximum coverage sampling technique to optimize the trade-off between computational cost and performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance on several 3D scene understanding benchmarks## including ScanRefer## Multi3DRefer## Scan2Cap## ScanQA## and SQA3D.,0,0

33002,,,Video-MME: The First-Ever Comprehensive Evaluation Benchmark of Multi-modal LLMs in Video Analysis,In the quest for artificial general intelligence## Multi-modal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have emerged as a focal point in recent advancements. However## the predominant focus remains on developing their capabilities in static image understanding. The potential of MLLMs to process sequential visual data is still insufficiently explored## highlighting the lack of a comprehensive## high-quality assessment of their performance. In this paper## we introduce Video-MME## the first-ever full-spectrum## Multi-Modal Evaluation benchmark of MLLMs in Video analysis.

Notably## the MLLMs are constrained by their limited context lengths and the substantial costs while processing long videos. Although several existing methods attempt to reduce visual tokens## their strategies encounter severe bottleneck## restricting MLLMs' ability to perceive fine-grained visual details. In this work## we propose Video-XL## a novel approach that leverages MLLMs' inherent key-value (KV) sparsification capacity to condense the visual input. Specifically## we introduce a new special token## the Visual Summarization Token (VST)## for each interval of the video## which summarizes the visual information within the interval as its associated KV. The VST module is trained by instruction fine-tuning## where two optimizing strategies are offered. 1. Curriculum learning## where VST learns to make small (easy) and large compression (hard) progressively. 2. Composite data curation## which integrates single-image## multi-image## and synthetic data to overcome the scarcity of long-video instruction data. The compression quality is further improved by dynamic compression## which customizes compression granularity based on the information density of different video intervals. Video-XL's effectiveness is verified from three aspects. First## it achieves a superior long-video understanding capability## outperforming state-of-the-art models of comparable sizes across multiple popular benchmarks. Second## it effectively preserves video information## with minimal compression loss even at 16x compression ratio.

33674,,2411.13281,VideoAutoArena: An Automated Arena for Evaluating Large Multimodal Models in Video Analysis through User Simulation,Large multimodal models (LMMs) with advanced video analysis capabilities have recently garnered significant attention. However## most evaluations rely on traditional methods like multiple-choice question answering in benchmarks such as VideoMME and LongVideoBench## which are prone to lack the depth needed to capture the complex demands of real-world users. To address this limitation--and due to the prohibitive cost and slow pace of human annotation for video tasks--we introduce VideoAutoArena## an arena-style benchmark inspired by LMSYS Chatbot Arena's framework## designed to automatically assess LMMs' video analysis abilities. VideoAutoArena utilizes user simulation to generate open-ended## adaptive questions that rigorously assess model performance in video understanding. The benchmark features an automated## scalable evaluation framework## incorporating a modified ELO Rating System for fair and continuous comparisons across multiple LMMs. To validate our automated judging system## we construct a 'gold standard' using a carefully curated subset of human annotations## demonstrating that our arena strongly aligns with human judgment while maintaining scalability.

Unlike existing benchmarks focused on static image-text compositionality or isolated single-event videos## our benchmark targets alignment in continuous multi-event videos. Leveraging video-text datasets with temporally localized event captions (e.g. ActivityNet-Captions## YouCook2)## we construct two compositional benchmarks## ActivityNet-Comp and YouCook2-Comp.

33095,,2412.14167,VideoDPO: Omni-Preference Alignment for Video Diffusion Generation,Recent progress in generative diffusion models has greatly advanced text-to-video generation. While text-to-video models trained on large-scale## diverse datasets can produce varied outputs## these generations often deviate from user preferences## highlighting the need for preference alignment on pre-trained models. Although Direct Preference Optimization (DPO) has demonstrated significant improvements in language and image generation## we pioneer its adaptation to video diffusion models and propose a VideoDPO pipeline by making several key adjustments. Unlike previous image alignment methods that focus solely on either (i) visual quality or (ii) semantic alignment between text and videos## we comprehensively consider both dimensions and construct a preference score accordingly## which we term the OmniScore. We design a pipeline to automatically collect preference pair data based on the proposed OmniScore and discover that re-weighting these pairs based on the score significantly impacts overall preference alignment.

34557,,2411.17592,VideoDirector: Precise Video Editing via Text-to-Video Models,Despite the typical inversion-then-editing paradigm using text-to-image (T2I) models has demonstrated promising results## directly extending it to text-to-video (T2V) models still suffers severe artifacts such as color flickering and content distortion. Consequently## current video editing methods primarily rely on T2I models## which inherently lack temporal-coherence generative ability## often resulting in inferior editing results.  In this paper## we attribute the failure of the typical editing paradigm to: 1) Tightly Spatial-temporal Coupling. The vanilla pivotal-based inversion strategy struggles to disentangle spatial-temporal information in the video diffusion model; 2) Complicated Spatial-temporal Layout. The vanilla cross-attention control strategy is deficient in preserving the unedited content. To address these limitations## we propose a spatial-temporal decoupled guidance (STDG) and multi-frame null-text optimization strategy to provide pivotal temporal cues for more precise pivotal inversion. Furthermore## we introduce a self-attention control strategy to maintain higher fidelity for precise partial content editing. Experimental results demonstrate that our method (termed VideoDirector) effectively harnesses the powerful temporal generation capabilities of T2V models## producing edited videos with state-of-the-art performance in accuracy## motion smoothness## realism## and fidelity to unedited content.,0,0

This allows to select the most relevant examples and rank them based on similarity## to be used for inference. If the generated response has low confidence## our framework selects new examples and performs inference again## iteratively refining the results until a high-confidence response is obtained.

However## T2A or V2A methods cannot generate holistic sounds (onscreen and off-screen). This is because T2A cannot generate sounds aligning with onscreen objects## while V2A cannot generate semantically complete (offscreen sounds missing). In this work## we address the task of holistic audio generation: given a video and a text prompt## we aim to generate both onscreen and offscreen sounds that are temporally synchronized with the video and semantically aligned with text and video. Previous approaches for joint text and video-to-audio generation often suffer from modality bias## favoring one modality over the other. To overcome this limitation## we introduce VinTAGe## a flow-based transformer model that jointly considers text and video to guide audio generation. Our framework comprises two key components: a Visual-Text Encoder and a Joint VT-SiT model. To reduce modality bias and improve generation quality## we employ pretrained uni-modal text-to-audio and video-to-audio generation models for additional guidance. Due to the lack of appropriate benchmarks## we also introduce VinTAGe-Bench## a dataset of 636 video-text-audio pairs containing both onscreen and offscreen sounds.

33155,,,Vision-Guided Action: Enhancing 3D Human Motion Prediction with Gaze-informed Affordance in 3D Scenes,Recent advances in human motion prediction (HMP) have shifted focus from isolated motion data to integrating human-scene correlations. In particular## the latest methods leverage human gaze points## using their spatial coordinates to indicate intent--where a person might move within a 3D environment. Despite promising trajectory results## these methods often produce inaccurate poses by overlooking the semantic implications of gaze## specifically the affordances of observed objects## which indicate the possible interactions. To address this## we propose GAP3DS## an affordance-aware HMP model that utilizes gaze-informed object affordances to improve HMP in complex 3D environments. GAP3DS incorporates a gaze-guided affordance learner to identify relevant objects in the scene and infer their affordances based on human gaze## thus contextualizing future human-object interactions. This affordance information## enriched with visual features and gaze data## conditions the generation of multiple human-object interaction poses## which are subsequently decoded into final motion predictions.

34751,,2504.14254,Visual Consensus Prompting for Co-Salient Object Detection,Existing co-salient object detection (CoSOD) methods generally employ a three-stage architecture (i.e.## encoding## consensus extraction & dispersion## and prediction) along with a typical full fine-tuning paradigm. Although they yield certain benefits## they exhibit two notable limitations: 1) This architecture relies on encoded features to facilitate consensus extraction## but the meticulously extracted consensus does not provide timely guidance to the encoding stage. 2) This paradigm involves globally updating all parameters of the model## which is parameter-inefficient and hinders the effective representation of knowledge within the foundation model for this task. Therefore## in this paper## we propose an interaction-effective and parameter-efficient concise architecture for the CoSOD task## addressing two key limitations. It introduces## for the first time## a parameter-efficient prompt tuning paradigm and seamlessly embeds consensus into the prompts to formulate task-specific Visual Consensus Prompts (VCP). Our VCP aims to induce the frozen foundation model to perform better on CoSOD tasks by formulating task-specific visual consensus prompts with minimized tunable parameters. Concretely## the primary insight of the purposeful Consensus Prompt Generator (CPG) is to enforce limited tunable parameters to focus on co-salient representations and generate consensus prompts. The formulated Consensus Prompt Disperser (CPD) leverages consensus prompts to form task-specific visual consensus prompts## thereby arousing the powerful potential of pre-trained models in addressing CoSOD tasks. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our concise VCP outperforms 13 cutting-edge full fine-tuning models## achieving the new state of the art (with 6.8% improvement in F_m metrics on the most challenging CoCA dataset).

To bridge this gap## we propose a diffusion-based causal visual representation learning framework called CIDiffuser to capture causal representations of visual attributes based on structural causal models to address the spurious correlation. Specifically## we first decompose the image representation into a high-level semantic representation for core attributes of the image and a low-level stochastic representation for other random or less structured aspects## with the former extracted by a semantic encoder and the latter derived via a stochastic encoder. We then introduce a causal effect learning module to capture the direct causal effect## that is## the difference of potential outcomes before and after intervening on the visual attributes.  In addition## a diffusion-based learning strategy is designed to optimize the representation learning process.

We show that splatting and its approximations are unnecessary## even within a rasterizer; we instead volumetrically integrate 3D Gaussians directly to compute the transmittance across them analytically. We use this analytic transmittance to derive more physically accurate alpha values than 3DGS## which can directly be used within their framework. The result is a method that more closely follows the volume rendering equation (similar to ray tracing) while enjoying the speed benefits of rasterization. Our method represents opaque surfaces with higher accuracy and fewer points than 3DGS. This enables it to outperform 3DGS for view synthesis (measured in SSIM and LPIPS). Being volumetrically consistent also enables our method to work out of the box for tomography. We match the state-of-the-art 3DGS-based tomography method with fewer points.

However## in real-world applications such as autonomous driving## points rarely move independently of others## especially for nearby points belonging to the same object## which often share the same motion. Incorporating this locally rigid motion constraint has been a key challenge in self-supervised scene flow estimation## which is often addressed by post-processing or appending extra regularization. While these approaches are able to improve the rigidity of predicted flows## they lack an architectural inductive bias for local rigidity within the model structure## leading to suboptimal learning efficiency and inferior performance. In contrast## we enforce local rigidity with a lightweight add-on module in neural network design## enabling end-to-end learning. We design a discretized voting space that accommodates all possible translations and then identify the one shared by nearby points by differentiable voting.  Additionally## to ensure computational efficiency## we operate on pillars rather than points and learn representative features for voting per pillar.

However## as the resolution and duration of generated videos increase## the encoding cost of Video VAEs becomes a limiting bottleneck in training LVDMs. Moreover## the block-wise inference method adopted by most LVDMs can lead to discontinuities of latent space when processing long-duration videos. The key to addressing the computational bottleneck lies in decomposing videos into distinct components and efficiently encoding the critical information. Wavelet transform can decompose videos into multiple frequency-domain components and improve the efficiency significantly## we thus propose Wavelet Flow VAE (WF-VAE)## an autoencoder that leverages multi-level wavelet transform to facilitate low-frequency energy flow into latent representation. Furthermore## we introduce a method called Causal Cache## which maintains the integrity of latent space during block-wise inference. Compared to state-of-the-art video VAEs## WF-VAE demonstrates superior performance in both PSNR and LPIPS metrics## achieving 2x higher throughput and 4x lower memory consumption while maintaining competitive reconstruction quality.

Despite avoiding the physical storage of the slides## WSIs require considerable data volume## which makes the storage and maintenance of WSI records costly and unsustainable. To this end## this work presents the first investigation of lossless compression of WSI images. Interestingly## we find that most existing compression methods fail to compress the WSI images effectively. Furthermore## our analysis reveals that the failure of existing compressors is mainly due to information irregularity in WSI images. To resolve this issue## we develop a simple yet effective lossless compressor called WISE## specifically designed for WSI images. WISE employs a hierarchical encoding strategy to extract effective bits## reducing the entropy of the image and then adopting a dictionary-based method to handle the irregular frequency patterns. Through extensive experiments## we show that WISE can effectively compress the gigapixel WSI images to 36 times on average and up to 136 times.,0,0
34082,,,WISH: Weakly Supervised Instance Segmentation using Heterogeneous Labels,Instance segmentation traditionally relies on dense pixel-level annotations## making it costly and labor-intensive. To alleviate this burden## weakly supervised instance segmentation utilizes cost-effective weak labels## such as image-level tags## points## and bounding boxes. However## existing approaches typically focus on a single type of weak label## overlooking the cost-efficiency potential of combining multiple types. In this paper## we introduce WISH## a novel heterogeneous framework for weakly supervised instance segmentation that integrates diverse weak label types within a single model. WISH unifies heterogeneous labels by leveraging SAM's prompt latent space through a multi-stage matching strategy## effectively compensating for the lack of spatial information in class tags.

Due to the hardness of labeling a multitude of waste images## it is infeasible to train a semantic segmentation model for this purpose directly. In this work## we construct a new dataset consisting of 12##208 waste images## upon which seed regions (i.e.## patches) are annotated and classified into 21 categories in a crowdsourcing fashion. To obtain pixel-level labels to train an effective segmentation model## we propose a weakly-supervised waste image pseudo label generation scheme## called WISNet. Specifically## we train a cohesive feature extractor with contrastive prototype learning## incorporating an unsupervised classification pretext task to help the extractor focus on more discriminative regions even with the same category. Furthermore## we propose an effective iterative patch expansion method to generate accurate pixel-level pseudo labels. Given these generated pseudo labels## a few-shot segmentation model can be trained to segment waste images. We implement and deploy WISNet in two real-world scenarios and conduct intensive experiments. Results show that WISNet can achieve a state-of-the-art 40.2% final segmentation mIoU on our waste benchmark## outperforming all other baselines and demonstrating the efficacy of WISNet.,0,0
34045,,,Watermarking One for All: A Robust Watermarking Scheme Against Partial Image Theft,The proliferation of digital images on the Internet has provided unprecedented convenience## but also poses significant risks of malicious theft and misuse. Digital watermarking has long been researched as an effective tool for copyright protection. However## it often falls short when addressing partial image theft## a common yet little-researched issue in practical applications. Most existing schemes typically require the entire image as input to extract watermarks. However## in practice## malicious users often steal only a portion of the image to create new content. The stolen portion can have arbitrary shape or content## being fused with a new background and may have undergone geometric transformations## making it challenging for current methods to extract correctly. To address the issues above## we propose WOFA (Watermarking One for All)## a robust watermarking scheme against partial image theft. First of all## we define the entire process of partial image theft and construct a dataset accordingly. To gain robustness against partial image theft## we then design a comprehensive distortion layer that incorporates the process of partial image theft and several common distortions in channel. For easier network convergence## we employ a multi-level network structure on the basis of the commonly used embedder-distortion layer-extractor architecture and adopt a progressive training strategy. Abundant experiments demonstrate that our superior performance in the scenario of partial image theft## offering a more reliable solution for protecting digital images against unauthorized use in practical use.,0,0

33955,,,Wavelet and Prototype Augmented Query-based Transformer for Pixel-level Surface Defect Detection,As an important part of intelligent manufacturing## pixel-level surface defect detection (SDD) aims to locate defect areas through mask prediction. Previous methods adopt the image-independent static convolution to indiscriminately classify per-pixel features for mask prediction## which leads to suboptimal results for some challenging scenes such as weak defects and cluttered backgrounds. In this paper## inspired by query-based methods## we propose a Wavelet and Prototype Augmented Query-based Transformer (WPFormer) for surface defect detection. Specifically##  a set of dynamic queries for mask prediction is updated through the dual-domain transformer decoder. Firstly## a Wavelet-enhanced Cross-Attention (WCA) is proposed## which aggregates meaningful high- and low-frequency information of image features in the wavelet domain to refine queries. WCA enhances the representation of high-frequency components by capturing multi-scale relationships between different frequency components## enabling queries to focus more on defect details. Secondly## a Prototype-guided Cross-Attention (PCA) is proposed to refine queries through meta-prototypes in the spatial domain. The prototypes aggregate semantically meaningful tokens from image features## facilitating queries to aggregate crucial defect information under the cluttered backgrounds. Extensive experiments on three defect detection datasets (i.e.## ESDIs-SOD## CrackSeg9k## and ZJU-Leaper) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art performance in defect detection.

In this work## we introduce WeGen## a model that unifies multimodal generation and understanding## and promotes their interplay in iterative generation. It can generate diverse results with high creativity for less detailed instructions. And it can progressively refine prior generation results or integrating specific contents from references following the instructions in its chat with users.

This results in residual correlations between non-robust features and labels## leading to suboptimal learning of robust features. However## achieving complete perturbation--perturbing as many non-robust features as possible--is challenging due to the difficulty in distinguishing robust and non-robust features and the sparsity of labeled data. To address these challenges## we propose a novel approach called Weakly Supervised Contrastive Adversarial Training (WSCAT). WSCAT ensures complete perturbation for improved learning of robust features by disrupting correlations between non-robust features and labels through complete AE generation over partially labeled data## grounded in information theory.

32410,,,Weakly Supervised Semantic Segmentation via Progressive Confidence Region Expansion,Weakly supervised semantic segmentation (WSSS) has garnered considerable attention due to its effective reduction of annotation costs. Most approaches utilize Class Activation Maps (CAM) to produce pseudo-labels## thereby localizing target regions using only image-level annotations. However## the prevalent methods relying on vision transformers (ViT) encounter an 'over-expansion' issue## i.e.## CAM incorrectly expands high activation value from the target object to the background regions## as it is difficult to learn pixel-level local intrinsic inductive bias in ViT from weak supervisions. To solve this problem## we propose a Progressive Confidence Region Expansion (PCRE) framework for WSSS## it gradually learns a faithful mask over the target region and utilizes this mask to correct the confusion in CAM. PCRE has two key components: Confidence Region Mask Expansion (CRME) and Class-Prototype Enhancement (CPE). CRME progressively expands the mask in the small region with the highest confidence## eventually encompassing the entire target## thereby avoiding unintended CPE aims to enhance mask generation in CRME by leveraging the similarity between the learned## dataset-level class prototypes and patch features as supervision to optimize the mask output from CRME. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms the existing single-stage and multi-stage approaches on the PASCAL VOC and MS COCO benchmark datasets.

One important assumption of KD is that the teacher's original dataset will also be available when training the student. However## in situations such as continual learning and distilling large models trained on company-withheld datasets## having access to the original data may not always be possible.

A Deep-Dive into the Vision of Vision Language Models,Vision-Language Models (VLMs) have recently demonstrated remarkable capabilities in comprehending complex visual content. However## the mechanisms underlying how VLMs process visual information remain largely unexplored. In this paper##  we conduct a thorough empirical analysis## focusing on the attention modules across layers## by which we reveal several key insights about how these models process visual data: (i) the internal representation of the query tokens (e.g.## representations of 'describe the image')## is utilized by the model to store global image information; we demonstrate that the model generates surprisingly descriptive responses solely from these tokens## without direct access to image tokens.  (ii) Cross-modal information flow is predominantly influenced by the middle layers (approximately 25% of all layers)## while early and late layers contribute only marginally. (iii) Fine-grained visual attributes and object details are directly extracted from image tokens in a spatially localized manner## i.e.## the generated tokens associated with a specific object or attribute attend strongly to their corresponding regions in the image.

To this end## our solution## DG2CD-Net## aims to construct a domain-independent## discriminative embedding space for GCD. The core innovation is an episodic training strategy that enhances cross-domain generalization by adapting a base model on tasks derived from source and synthetic domains generated by a foundation model. Each episode focuses on a cross-domain GCD task## diversifying task setups over episodes and combining open-set domain adaptation with a novel margin loss and representation learning for optimizing the feature space progressively. To capture the effects of fine-tunings on the base model## we extend task arithmetic by adaptively weighting the local task vectors concerning the fine-tuned models based on their GCD performance on a validation distribution. This episodic update mechanism boosts the adaptability of the base model to unseen targets. Experiments across three datasets confirm that DG2CD-Net outperforms existing GCD methods customized for DG-GCD,0,0

To counter this## Deepfake detectors have been developed as reliable tools for assessing face authenticity. These detectors are typically developed on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) and trained using third-party datasets. However## this protocol raises a new security risk that can seriously undermine the trustfulness of Deepfake detectors: Once the third-party data providers insert poisoned (corrupted) data maliciously## Deepfake detectors trained on these datasets will be injected 'backdoors' that cause abnormal behavior when presented with samples containing specific triggers.

We propose a weakly supervised approach that leverages language accompanying an instructional multi-view video as a means to recover its most informative viewpoint(s). Our key hypothesis is that the more accurately an individual view can predict a view-agnostic text summary## the more informative it is. To put this into action## we propose LangView## a framework that uses the relative accuracy of view dependent caption predictions as a proxy for best view pseudo-labels. Then## those pseudo-labels are used to train a view selector## together with an auxiliary camera pose predictor that enhances view-sensitivity.

33098,,2503.06287,Your Large Vision-Language Model Only Needs A Few Attention Heads For Visual Grounding,Visual grounding seeks to localize the image region corresponding to a free-form text description. Recently## the strong multimodal capabilities of Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) have driven substantial improvements in visual grounding## though they inevitably require fine-tuning and additional model components to explicitly generate bounding boxes or segmentation masks. However## we discover that a few attention heads in frozen LVLMs demonstrate strong visual grounding capabilities. We refer to these heads## which consistently capture object locations related to text semantics## as localization heads. Using localization heads## we introduce a straightforward and effective training-free visual grounding framework that utilizes text-to-image attention maps from localization heads to identify the target objects. Surprisingly## only three out of thousands of attention heads are sufficient to achieve competitive localization performance compared to existing LVLM-based visual grounding methods that require fine-tuning. Our findings suggest that LVLMs can innately ground objects based on a deep comprehension of the text-image relationship## as they implicitly focus on relevant image regions to generate informative text outputs.,0,0
33058,,,Your Scale Factors are My Weapon: Targeted Bit-Flip Attacks on Vision Transformers via Scale Factor Manipulation,Vision Transformers (ViTs) have experienced significant progress and are quantized for deployment in resource-constrained applications. Quantized models are vulnerable to targeted bit-flip attacks (BFAs). A targeted BFA prepares a trigger and a corresponding Trojan/backdoor## inserting the latter (with RowHammer bit flipping) into a victim model## to mislead its classification on samples containing the trigger. Existing targeted BFAs on quantized ViTs are limited in that: (1) they require numerous bit-flips## and (2) the separation between flipped bits is below 4 KB## making attacks infeasible with RowHammer in real-world scenarios. We propose a new and practical targeted attack Flip-S against quantized ViTs. The core insight is that in quantized models## a scale factor change ripples through a batch of model weights. Consequently## flipping bits in scale factors## rather than solely in model weights## enables more cost-effective attacks. We design a Scale-Factor-Search (SFS) algorithm to identify critical bits in scale factors for flipping## and adopt a mutual exclusion strategy to guarantee a 4 KB separation between flips. We evaluate Flip-S on CIFAR-10 and ImageNet datasets across five ViT architectures and two quantization levels. Results show that Flip-S achieves attack success rate (ASR) exceeding 90.0% on all models with 50 bits flipped## outperforming baselines with ASR typically below 80.0%. Furthermore## compared to the SOTA## Flip-S reduces the number of required bit-flips by 8x-20xwhile reaching equal or higher ASR. Our source code is publicly available.,0,0
33107,,2503.19108,Your ViT is Secretly an Image Segmentation Model,Vision Transformers (ViTs) have shown remarkable performance and scalability across various computer vision tasks. To apply single-scale ViTs to image segmentation## existing methods adopt a convolutional adapter to generate multi-scale features## a pixel decoder to fuse these features## and a Transformer decoder that uses the fused features to make predictions. In this paper## we show that the inductive biases introduced by these task-specific components can instead be learned by the ViT itself## given sufficiently large models and extensive pre-training. Based on these findings## we introduce the Encoder-only Mask Transformer (EoMT)## which repurposes the plain ViT architecture to conduct image segmentation. With large-scale models and pre-training## EoMT obtains a segmentation accuracy similar to state-of-the-art models that use task-specific components. At the same time## EoMT is significantly faster than these methods due to its architectural simplicity## e.g.## up to 4x faster with ViT-L. Across a range of model sizes## EoMT demonstrates an optimal balance between segmentation accuracy and prediction speed## suggesting that compute resources are better spent on scaling the ViT itself rather than adding architectural complexity.

To reduce the data requirements## a natural solution is to leverage existing data-free static avatar generation methods## such as pre-trained diffusion models with score distillation sampling (SDS)## which align avatars with pseudo ground-truth outputs from the diffusion model. However## directly distilling 4D avatars from video diffusion often leads to over-smooth results due to spatial and temporal inconsistencies in the generated video. To address this issue## we propose Zero-1-to-A## a robust method that synthesizes a spatial and temporal consistency dataset for 4D avatar reconstruction using the video diffusion model. Specifically## Zero-1-to-A iteratively constructs video datasets and optimizes animatable avatars in a progressive manner## ensuring that avatar quality increases smoothly and consistently throughout the learning process. This progressive learning involves two stages: (1) Spatial Consistency Learning fixes expressions and learns from front-to-side views## and (2) Temporal Consistency Learning fixes views and learns from relaxed to exaggerated expressions## generating 4D avatars in a simple-to-complex manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Zero-1-to-A improves fidelity## animation quality## and rendering speed compared to existing diffusion-based methods## providing a solution for lifelike avatar creation.

However## traditional head-swapping methods heavily rely on face-centered cropped data with primarily frontal-facing views## which limits their effectiveness in real-world applications. Additionally## their masking methods## designed to indicate regions requiring editing## are optimized for these types of dataset but struggle to achieve seamless blending in complex situations## such as when the original data includes features like long hair extending beyond the masked area.

32463,,2412.20596,Zero-Shot Image Restoration Using Few-Step Guidance of Consistency Models (and Beyond),In recent years## it has become popular to tackle image restoration tasks with a single pretrained diffusion model (DM) and data-fidelity guidance## instead of training a dedicated deep neural network per task. However## such 'zero-shot' restoration schemes currently require many Neural Function Evaluations (NFEs) for performing well## which may be attributed to the many NFEs needed in the original generative functionality of the DMs. Recently## faster variants of DMs have been explored for image generation. These include Consistency Models (CMs)## which can generate samples via a couple of NFEs. However## existing works that use guided CMs for restoration still require tens of NFEs or fine-tuning of the model per task that leads to performance drop if the assumptions during the fine-tuning are not accurate. In this paper## we propose a zero-shot restoration scheme that uses CMs and operates well with as little as 4 NFEs. It is based on a wise combination of several ingredients: better initialization## back-projection guidance## and above all a novel noise injection mechanism.

33335,,,Zero-shot 3D Question Answering via Voxel-based Dynamic Token Compression,Recent advancements in 3D Large Multi-modal Models (3D-LMMs) have driven significant progress in 3D question answering. However## recent multi-frame Vision-Language Models (VLMs) demonstrate superior performance compared to 3D-LMMs on 3D question answering tasks## largely due to the greater scale and diversity of available 2D image data in contrast to the more limited 3D data.

35158,,2503.10412,dFLMoE: Decentralized Federated Learning via Mixture of Experts for Medical Data Analysis,Federated learning has wide applications in the medical field. It enables knowledge sharing among different healthcare institutes while protecting patients' privacy. However## existing federated learning systems are typically centralized## requiring clients to upload client-specific knowledge to a central server for aggregation.
